## PGA Tour Project Code Sheets

**API PULL AND DATA WRANGLING** This sheet contains all the data ingestion and wrangling from the project. The data was pulled from the SportsData.io API. The performance results were 
given on a hole by hole basis, so the pull also transforms the data into round scores. Player statistics were also taken from a kaggle dataset.

**Exploratory Analysis** The exploratory analysis contains a series of bar charts and scatterplots from the performance data. It also contains all the dendrograms created from the coorelation matricies.
Finally, it contains the code for the spider plot player comparisons.

**Regression Analysis** The regression analysis contains all attempts at the regression model with different dependent and independent variables.
