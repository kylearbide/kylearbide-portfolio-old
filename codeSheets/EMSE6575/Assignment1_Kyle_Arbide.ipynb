For model fitting, we reshape the images and split the model into training and test sets. After fitting the model, we return the shape of the predictions back to (8,8) to display our predictions over their corresponding images. The classification report and confusion matrix give us the accuracy of our model, as well as the precision and recall scores for each label."

These copies are respectively in the\\r\\nhandwriting of\\n   <span class=\"smcap\">\\n    Washington\\n   </span>\\n   \\'s private secretaries, viz:—Major William\\r\\nJackson: Tobias Lear: Bartholomew Dandridge and G.

He was a lawyer by profession\\r\\nand served as Deputy Grand Master for the year 1795 under the Venerable\\r\\nWilliam Ball, and as Right Worshipful Grand Master for the years\\r\\n1796-1797. He was appointed by the President as agent for the settlement\\r\\nof claims that were provided for in the Sixth Article of John Jay\\'s\\r\\nTreaty, and visited England in 1803 to close the commission. He died at\\r\\nthe Smith Homestead at Falls of Schuylkill, March 12, 1821.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n   Both the address and reply were copied in\\n   <span class=\"smcap\">\\n    Washington\\n   </span>\\n   \\'s Letter Book III,\\r\\npp. 244-245, in the handwriting of one of his secretaries, G.

Several cases of this kind have of\\r\\nlate come under the notice of the writer. In one case where one of these\\r\\nreproductions was offered for sale, hundreds of dollars were asked for\\r\\nthe reproduction, and it was with great difficulty that the owner could\\r\\nbe convinced of its character.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n   Another use made of this letter by unprincipled persons was to make a\\r\\nphoto-lithographic copy of the letter, and substitute the name of\\r\\nanother state for that of Pennsylvania, and then palm it off upon the\\r\\nauthorities of that state as an original letter to their Grand Lodge.\\r\\nThe latest case of this kind known to the writer is that of the Grand\\r\\nLodge of Georgia, who were thus imposed upon.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n   Then again the letter has been extensively used for advertising purposes\\r\\nby publishing houses of Masonic literature.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n   The letter has also been printed in most all books bearing upon Masonic\\r\\nhistory during the revolutionary period.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n   It was also frequently quoted and criticised during the Anti-Masonic\\r\\ncraze which swept over the country some eighty-odd years ago, it being\\r\\nthe chief Masonic letter of the five known to the leaders of those\\r\\nmisguided persons. The main point of their argument was that it bore no\\r\\ndate and therefore was not authentic.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n   <a id=\"vernon\" name=\"vernon\">\\n   </a>\\n  </p>\\n  <div class=\"figcenter\">\\n   <img alt=\"MOUNT VERNON\" src=\"images/i131.jpg\"/>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"caption\">\\n   MOUNT VERNON\\n   <br/>\\n   <small>\\n    DURING WASHINGTON\\'S OCCUPANCY, 1788-1799.\\n   </small>\\n  </div>\\n  <p>\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n   <span class=\"u\">\\n    Footnotes:\\n   </span>\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n   <a href=\"#f58.1\" id=\"f58\" name=\"f58\">\\n    [58]\\n   </a>\\n   Cf.

In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</pre>\\n </body>\\n</html>\\n'"

In this collection, were also found some of the\\r\\noriginal drafts of Washington\\'s replies, together with copies of the\\r\\nvarious masonic addresses and letters to him, and in the case of Dominie\\r\\nSnyder, press copies of his answers.\\nIn the present work an attempt has been made to group this matter\\r\\ntogether in chronological order, also to show some of the surroundings\\r\\nand conditions under which this correspondence was made, and of the\\r\\nBrethren who were prominent in the presentation[Pg 2] of these Eleven\\r\\nAddresses, which came to him from Seven of the Thirteen Colonies.\\nA complete set of photostatic fac-similes of these documents in the\\r\\nLibrary of Congress, has been secured for the Museum of the Grand Lodge\\r\\nof Pennsylvania. Efforts were also made to obtain photographic copies of\\r\\nsuch of the Washington Masonic letters as were still in existence, which\\r\\nwere successful except in two instances as noted in the text.\\nIt will be noted that on April 30, 1789, Washington, while Master of his\\r\\nLodge, was inaugurated President of the United States; this is the only\\r\\ninstance where one of the fourteen Presidents, who were Members of our\\r\\nFraternity was a Master of a Lodge during their term as President.\\nThe esteem in which Washington held the Masonic Fraternity, is shown by\\r\\nthe fact, that in almost every case he had both the address and his\\r\\nreply, copied upon opposite pages of one of his folio letter-books, now\\r\\nin the Library of Congress. These copies are respectively in the\\r\\nhandwriting of Washington\\'s private secretaries, viz:—Major William\\r\\nJackson: Tobias Lear: Bartholomew Dandridge and G. W. Craik.\\nIn addition to the above copies we have Washington\\'s original drafts of\\r\\nhis letters to Watson and Cassoul, to the Grand Lodges of Massachusetts,\\r\\nSouth Carolina, and Maryland, to Paul Revere, and[Pg 3] as before stated\\r\\npress copies of his answers to Mr. Snyder.\\nA perusal of these original documents, as here presented, affords an\\r\\nexcellent illustration of the entente cordiale, which existed between\\r\\nWashington and his Masonic Brethren.\\nUpon the other hand, how the Masonic Fraternity, during Washington\\'s\\r\\nlifetime, venerated their august Brother, is shown by the addresses of\\r\\nthis correspondence as retained by Washington.\\nAlso by the various Masonic Memorial services held, after Washington\\'s\\r\\ndeath, the chief of which was in Philadelphia, under the auspices of the\\r\\nGrand Lodge of Pennsylvania. The Masonic services held in every State of\\r\\nthe Union, the many Eulogies and Sermons delivered and printed are\\r\\nmatters of history.\\nHow this veneration of the great Washington continued during the past\\r\\nyears, is shown by the fact that there are no less than 53 Masonic\\r\\nLodges in the United States, named after the illustrious Brother. This\\r\\nis independent of the numerous Royal Arch Chapters, Commanderies, and\\r\\nother Masonic bodies, that bear the name \"Washington.\"\\nWashington Lodges are found in thirty-eight of the forty-eight States of\\r\\nthe American Union.\\nThe other ten States, which thus far have no \"Washington Lodge\" within\\r\\ntheir Jurisdiction, are Mississippi and Texas, together with the newer\\r\\nwestern States lately admitted into the American Union,[Pg 4] viz:—Nevada,\\r\\nNorth Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.\\nIn addition to the fifty-three Washington Lodges, there is also one each\\r\\nin Canada, the Island of Cuba and the District of Columbia.\\nIn the Masonic Fraternity throughout the world, the name of Washington\\r\\nis ever kept in remembrance, as one of the brightest luminaries in the\\r\\nMasonic constellation, one of the most prominent examples, being his\\r\\nfull length oil portrait in Masonic clothing in the Hall of the Grand\\r\\nLodge of England at London.\\nAcknowledgments are due to the Hon. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of\\r\\nCongress, for placing these documents at the disposal of the writer, and\\r\\ngiving permission to have photostat copies made of same; also to J.\\r\\nHenry Williams, Esq., R. W. Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania and\\r\\nMasonic Jurisdiction thereunto belonging, for suggestions and\\r\\nencouragement in the preparation of this work.\\n\\nPhiladelphia, February 22, A.D. 1915—A.L. 5915.\\n\\n\\n[Pg 5]\\n\\nThe Masonic Correspondence\\r\\nof Washington\\n\\nMuch has been written pro and con about Washington and his connection\\r\\nwith the Masonic Fraternity. Thus far no complete set of his Masonic\\r\\nwritings have been compiled or published. Such portions as have been\\r\\nprinted were fragmentary, and issued for what may be called local\\r\\npurposes.\\nHow careful Washington was of his Masonic correspondence is shown by the\\r\\nfact that he had copies made, in his private letter books, of most all\\r\\nletters sent him by the various Masonic Grand and Subordinate bodies,\\r\\nand his answers thereto, usually upon opposite pages. He thus had both\\r\\nthe addresses and his reply at hand for easy reference. This fact shows\\r\\nthe esteem in which Washington[Pg 6] held his Brethren of the Masonic\\r\\nFraternity, as well as his own opinion of Freemasonry.\\nThese letter-books are now in the Library of Congress, and photostat\\r\\ncopies of such as relate to Freemasonry have been made for the Library\\r\\nof the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.\\nAs to the authenticity of the Washington Letter Books, and how they came\\r\\ninto the possession of the United States Government is explained by the\\r\\nfollowing statement by Mr. Galliard Hunt, chief Manuscript division,\\r\\nLibrary of Congress:[1]\\n\\r\\n\"They are a part of the Washington papers in\\r\\n\"the Government\\'s possession, purchased from the\\r\\n\"Washington family, one lot in 1834 and the re-\\r\\n\"mainder in 1849, and deposited in the Department\\r\\n\"of State until 1903, when, by the President\\'s order,\\r\\n\"they were sent to this Library. They range in date\\r\\n\"from 1754 to 1799. Some of them are partly\\r\\n\"or wholly in Washington\\'s hand-writing, and others\\r\\n\"in the writing of his secretaries and their clerks.\\r\\n\"There are no volumes of press copies, but there are\\r\\n\"some press copies among the papers.\"\\n\\xa0\\nWashington in writing his answer to the various greetings, in most cases\\r\\nwould first make a rough copy of his reply, then digest, alter, correct\\r\\nor change such parts or sentences as he thought proper. Then [Pg 7]after\\r\\ndeliberate consideration, a fair copy would be made either by Washington\\r\\nor one of his Secretaries and signed by him, and sent to the Masonic\\r\\nbodies for which they were intended.\\nFortunately some of the original drafts of these Masonic letters have\\r\\ncome down to us; thus far five autographic copies have been found among\\r\\nthe Washington papers in the Library of Congress at Washington.\\n1. Draft of letter written at Newburg, New York, August 19, 1782, to\\r\\nWatson and Cassoul of Nantes, France, thanking them for the Masonic\\r\\nApron, embroidered by the nuns at Nantes, and which is now in possession\\r\\nof Alexandria-Washington Lodge, No. 22, at Alexandria, Virginia.\\n2. To the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts.\\n3. To the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.\\n4. To the Grand Lodge of South Carolina.\\n5. To the Grand Lodge of Maryland; this draft is a two-page letter\\r\\nwritten upon a letter sheet and shows many changes and corrections; it\\r\\nis dated 1798.\\nIn addition to the above original drafts there were found several\\r\\naddresses and the accompanying answers, which thus far have never been\\r\\npublished, in fact no mention of them has ever appeared in print, viz:—\\n1.

This the\\r\\nGrand Officers refused to do.\\nIn return Sparks sent the following letter to the Chairman:\\n\"Boston, February 18, 1833.\\n\"Sir,—I received this morning your letter of the 15th instant,\\r\\nin which you inquire:\\n\"Whether I have yet seen or had in my possession[Pg 11] any original\\r\\nletter or letters, in the hand writing of General Washington,\\r\\naddressed to any body of men denominating themselves Freemasons.\\n\"In reply, I can only state that I have seen no letters from\\r\\nGeneral Washington of the kind described in yours, nor received any\\r\\ncommunication on the subject, either verbal or written.[6]\\n\"I am, Sir,\\n\"Very respectfully,\\n\"Your ob\\'t servant,\\n\"Jared Sparks.\"\\n\\xa0\\nHow Sparks could have overlooked the numerous entries in the letter\\r\\nbooks whose numbers and folios are here quoted, also the drafts of\\r\\nreplies in Washington\\'s hand-writing and signed by him (copies of which\\r\\nare here given in this work), can only be accounted for by the fact that\\r\\nhe must have been carried away by the political excitement of the day.\\nWashington\\'s connection with the Masonic Fraternity has been\\r\\nexhaustively traced by Brother James M. Lamberton, Past Master of\\r\\nPerseverance Lodge, No. 21, in his address \"Washington as a Freemason,\"\\r\\nfrom the day of his entrance into Fredericksburg Lodge, No. 4, of\\r\\nVirginia, September 1, 1752, until the day of his death, December 14,\\r\\n1799, before the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, at its celebration of the\\r\\nSesqui-Centennial [Pg 12]Anniversary of the Initiation of Brother George\\r\\nWashington into the Fraternity of Freemasons,[7] held in the Masonic\\r\\nTemple, in the city of Philadelphia on Wednesday, November 5, 1902.\\nIt must also be remembered that Washington made a public profession of\\r\\nhis membership in Philadelphia, Monday, December 28, 1778, when he\\r\\nwalked in procession with his brethren of the Grand Lodge of\\r\\nPennsylvania, from the College at Fourth and Arch Streets to Christ\\r\\nChurch on Second Street above Market Street, Philadelphia, where, after\\r\\na prayer by Rev. William White, a sermon was preached for the \"[Benefit\\r\\nof the POOR] by appointment of and before | The General Communication |\\r\\nof | Free and Accepted | MASONS | of the | State of PENNSYLVANIA, | on\\r\\nMonday, December 28, 1788, | Celebrated, agreeable to their\\r\\nConstitution, | as the Anniversary of | ST.

Brother William Smith, D.D., preached a number of Masonic Sermons\\r\\nin Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland; three of which delivered at the\\r\\nrequest of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania were printed, viz.:\\nSermon 1.—On Brotherly Love, &c. Preached on the Anniversary of St.\\r\\nJohn the Baptist, June 24, 1755,\\nSermon 2.—Preached on Monday, December 28, 1778, celebrated as the\\r\\nAnniversary of St. John the Evangelist.

In the year 1798 he was again elected to that honorable\\r\\noffice, serving five more consecutive years (1798 to 1802), when he\\r\\ndeclined reëlection.

Further, that\\r\\nWashington kept more or less in touch with [Pg 87]his Masonic Brethren of the\\r\\nGrand Lodge of Pennsylvania is shown by the fact that he attended the\\r\\nservices at St. Paul\\'s Episcopal Church, on Third Street below Walnut,\\r\\non St. John\\'s Day, December 27, 1793, where a charity sermon was\\r\\npreached by Rev.

William Smith,\\r\\nD.D., born in Philadelphia, June 1, 1759. He was a lawyer by profession\\r\\nand served as Deputy Grand Master for the year 1795 under the Venerable\\r\\nWilliam Ball, and as Right Worshipful Grand Master for the years\\r\\n1796-1797. He was appointed by the President as agent for the settlement\\r\\nof claims that were provided for in the Sixth Article of John Jay\\'s\\r\\nTreaty, and visited England in 1803 to close the commission. He died at\\r\\nthe Smith Homestead at Falls of Schuylkill, March 12, 1821.\\nBoth the address and reply were copied in Washington\\'s Letter Book III,\\r\\npp. 244-245, in the handwriting of one of his secretaries, G.

Several cases of this kind have of\\r\\nlate come under the notice of the writer. In one case where one of these\\r\\nreproductions was offered for sale, hundreds of dollars were asked for\\r\\nthe reproduction, and it was with great difficulty that the owner could\\r\\nbe convinced of its character.\\nAnother use made of this letter by unprincipled persons was to make a\\r\\nphoto-lithographic copy of the letter, and substitute the name of\\r\\nanother state for that of Pennsylvania, and then palm it off upon the\\r\\nauthorities of that state as an original letter to their Grand Lodge.\\r\\nThe latest case of this kind known to the writer is that of the Grand\\r\\nLodge of Georgia, who were thus imposed upon.\\nThen again the letter has been extensively used for advertising purposes\\r\\nby publishing houses of Masonic literature.\\nThe letter has also been printed in most all books bearing upon Masonic\\r\\nhistory during the revolutionary period.\\nIt was also frequently quoted and criticised during the Anti-Masonic\\r\\ncraze which swept over the country some eighty-odd years ago, it being\\r\\nthe chief Masonic letter of the five known to the leaders of those\\r\\nmisguided persons. The main point of their argument was that it bore no\\r\\ndate and therefore was not authentic.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMOUNT VERNON\\nDURING WASHINGTON\\'S OCCUPANCY, 1788-1799.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFootnotes:\\n[58] Cf.

The\\r\\nspreading of such doctrines was by many ascribed to the\\r\\n\\'Illuminati,\\' who were supposed to be Masons. During this period\\r\\n[Pg 118]clubs like the Jacobin Clubs in France were formed in this\\r\\ncountry, and the spread of these doctrines was greatly feared,\\r\\nespecially by the clergy, and in 1798 one of them, one G.

SNYDER.—SEPTEMBER 25, 1798.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n[Pg 123]This man Snyder (Schneider) was an agitator and thoroughly irresponsible\\r\\nperson, having no ecclesiastical connection with any organized Church\\r\\nBody.\\nIn the year 1787, Schneider came from Albany, New York, to Frederick,\\r\\nostensibly to collect money to build a Church. He was kindly received\\r\\nand permitted to preach in the Reformed Congregation, where he soon\\r\\nfomented discord and trouble.\\nSchneider was soon driven out of Frederick Town, but returned again in\\r\\n1794, when he renewed the trouble in the Church, which ended in a\\r\\nschism. The matter finally got into the Civil Court, and on February 15,\\r\\n1800 the case was decided against him, which ended his activity in\\r\\nFrederick Town; soon after which he left for parts unknown.[67]\\nSnyder, who was not a native of this country, evidently labored under\\r\\nthe impression that Washington was a Grand Master General, who presided\\r\\nover all of the English (or Symbolic) Masonic Lodges in the United\\r\\nStates. Snyder evidently used the term \"English\" Lodges, to distinguish\\r\\nthem from the Masonic bodies working in the so-called higher (Scotch)\\r\\ndegrees, as are now known as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.\\nHow important Washington considered this correspondence is shown by his\\r\\nprecaution in taking a press copy of both of his letters to Snyder, who\\r\\nhe [Pg 124]was led to believe was the regular pastor of the German Reformed\\r\\nCongregation at Fredericktown. These are now in the Library of Congress.\\r\\nIt will be noted that in all of his other Masonic correspondence, copies\\r\\nwere made in his regular letter books by his clerks, of both address and\\r\\nreply. Brother Washington evidently surmised that this letter from\\r\\nSnyder was nothing more or less than a scheme to entrap him. It was not\\r\\nuntil a month had elapsed, and then only after due consideration, that\\r\\nthe following reply was sent to Fredericktown, viz.:\\n\\n\"Mount Vernon, 25th Sept. 1798.\\n\"Sir,\\n\"Many apologies are\\r\\n\"due to you, for my not acknowledging\\r\\n\"the receipt of your obliging favour of\\nfor\\r\\n\"the 22d ult, and ^ not thanking you, at\\r\\n\"an earlier period for the Book you\\r\\n\"had the goodness to send me.\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard much of the ne-\\r\\n\"farious & dangerous plan, & doctrines\\r\\n\"of the Illuminati, but never saw the\\r\\n\"Book until you were pleased to send\\r\\n\"it to me.

G. W. SNYDER.—OCTOBER 24, 1798.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n[Pg 126]In this letter Washington was correct in stating that he had not\\r\\npresided over the \"English Lodges in this Country,\" undoubtedly meaning\\r\\nas Grand Master General.\\nWhere Washington says \"The fact is I preside over none,\" he meant that\\r\\nhe did not then preside over any individual lodge, as he at that time\\r\\nwas a Past Master of Alexandria Lodge, No. 22, of Virginia.[68]\\nWhere he says \"Nor have I been in one, [meaning an individual lodge]\\r\\nmore than once or twice within the last thirty years,\" he obviously\\r\\nhad in view his occasional visits to the various lodges during that\\r\\nperiod, and that he could not, on account of his official duties and\\r\\nother conditions, attend any lodge regularly.\\nAs a matter of record, Washington was a member of Alexandria Lodge, No.\\r\\n39, of Pennsylvania,[69] and attended some of its meetings at Alexandria\\r\\nin 1783 and 1784, as is shown by the Minutes of the Lodge, and the\\r\\nrecords here presented.[70] Further, that when the Brethren of\\r\\nAlexandria Lodge, No. 39, changed their allegiance from Pennsylvania to\\r\\nVirginia, General Washington was especially named in the warrant, after\\r\\nhis consent having been [Pg 127]first obtained,[71]\\r\\nand thereby became the Warrant Master of Lodge No. 22, under the Virginia jurisdiction, April\\r\\n28, 1788, serving as such until December 20 following, when, as the\\r\\nminutes of that date show,[72] he was unanimously elected to succeed\\r\\nhimself for the full term, serving in all about twenty months.\\nThe records further show that, in 1778, Washington occupied the chief\\r\\nposition in the procession at the celebration of St. John the Evangelist\\r\\nby the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia in 1778, in which\\r\\nmore than three hundred Brethren joined.[73]\\nHe also occupied the same position when he laid the corner stone of the\\r\\npresent capitol at Washington, September 18, 1793, clothed with the\\r\\nMasonic Apron presented by Lafayette, which is now in the Museum of the\\r\\nGrand Lodge of Pennsylvania. Upon both of these occasions, Washington\\r\\nmade a public profession of his membership in the Masonic Fraternity.\\nRecords show that Washington was present at the meeting of American\\r\\nUnion Lodge (a Military [Pg 128]Lodge), at Morristown, N. J., December 27,\\r\\n1779;[74] at American Union Lodge at Nelson\\'s point on the Hudson June\\r\\n24, 1782;[75] at King Solomon\\'s Lodge of Poughkeepsie, December 27,\\r\\n1782, and occasionally at Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, in 1783-1784, and\\r\\nthe Virginia Lodge, No. 22, between the years 1788 and 1797.[76]\\nWashington in the next paragraph of his letter to Snyder makes his\\r\\nmeaning absolutely clear, that while he had not attended any Lodge\\r\\nregularly during the past thirty years he plainly states: \"I believe\\r\\nnotwithstanding, that none of the Lodges in this Country are\\r\\ncontaminated with the principles ascribed to the society of the Illuminati.\"\\nThis belief is further accentuated by the letter to the Grand Lodge of\\r\\nMaryland a few weeks after the above letter was written to Snyder.\\nIn addition to above records, there are numerous traditions of\\r\\nWashington\\'s occasional visits to Masonic Lodges and functions:[77] all\\r\\nof which fall within the thirty years mentioned in the Snyder\\r\\nLetter.[78]\\nFurther, Washington\\'s great interest in Free[Pg 129]masonry is shown by the\\r\\nmany addresses received from different Grand and Subordinate Lodges\\r\\nthroughout the Union, all of which he acknowledged in fraternal terms,\\r\\nalso by the various Masonic constitutions and sermons dedicated to him,\\r\\nwhich he received with thanks and were preserved in his library.\\nIt will be noted that in the fifth line from the bottom, \"Within the\\r\\nlast thirty years,\" which in all Anti-Masonic publications is printed\\r\\nin italics, the word \"thirty\" was not in the body of the letter as\\r\\noriginally written, but was an afterthought and interlined before the press copy was taken.\\nIn the press copy of this letter, it will be noted that the word written\\r\\nover the words \"last years,\" is almost indecipherable; in the\\r\\nphotostat it is completely so. This has led some investigators to\\r\\nquestion whether the interlined word is really \"thirty.\"\\nThe surmise that the blur in the press copy of[Pg 130] Washington\\'s letter to\\r\\nSnyder, was \"thirty\" was first promulgated by Jared Sparks, when he\\r\\nfurnished the text of the letter to the Anti-Masonic agitators, during\\r\\nthe political excitement which swept over the New England States in the\\r\\nsecond decade of the nineteenth century.\\nSnyder, upon receipt of this letter, undoubtedly after consultation with\\r\\npersons who were politically opposed to Washington or antagonistic to\\r\\nthe Masonic Fraternity, wrote a second letter and sent it to Mount\\r\\nVernon under date of October 17, 1798; no copy of this letter has thus\\r\\nfar been found among the Washington papers in the Library of Congress.\\nWashington immediately sent the following sharp reply to Snyder, in\\r\\nwhich he plainly sets forth his belief that the Masonic Lodges in the\\r\\nUnited States were not interested in the propagation of the tenets of\\r\\nwhat was then known as Jacobism or the Illuminati. The words as\\r\\nunderscored in the original letter by Washington were to emphasize his\\r\\nmeaning upon this subject.\\nPhotostats of both of the above letter press copies are in the Archives\\r\\nof the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.\\n\\n\"Mount Vernon 24th Oct. 1798.\\n\"Rev. Sir,\\n\"I have you favor of the\\ntive\\r\\n\"17th instant before me and my only mo:\\n[Pg 131]\"to trouble you with the receipt of this let\\r\\n\"ter, is to explain, and correct a mistake\\r\\n\"which I perceive the hurry in which I\\r\\n\"am obliged, often to write letters, have\\r\\n\"led you into.—\\n\\r\\n\"It was not my intention to doubt\\r\\n\"that, the doctrines of the Illuminati, and\\r\\n\"principles of Jacobism had not spread\\r\\n\"in the United States.

No man ever stood higher in the estimation of the\\r\\npeople of Maryland than Washington, and his death awakened genuine\\r\\nsorrow. On February 22d, 1800, memorial services were observed in the\\r\\nReformed Church at Fredericktown.[79] It was a solemn day and the whole\\r\\nCounty was in mourning; at which time Ex-Governor Thomas Johnson\\r\\npronounced the funeral oration. Snyder took no part in these services.\\nThe two letters to Snyder were chiefly relied upon by the Anti-Masons to\\r\\nsupport their political claims.\\n[Pg 133]\"That Washington was never in a Lodge but twice, in his life; that\\r\\nhe paid no attention to Masonry during the war; that in 1781 he\\r\\ndeclined being addressed by Masons as a brother Mason, and in 1798\\r\\nwas very particular to insist upon the fact that he had not been in\\r\\na Lodge, but once or twice in 30 years, and knew nothing of their\\r\\nprinciples and practices.\"[80]\\n\\xa0\\nHow false these statements so frequently made, is shown by the many\\r\\nproofs here presented in fac-simile of the originals, which also\\r\\nabsolutely controvert the statement in Governor Ritner\\'s Vindication? viz:—\\n\"That all the letters said to be written by Washington to Lodges\\r\\nare spurious. This is rendered nearly certain: First, by the\\r\\nnon-production of the originals: Second, by the absence of copies\\r\\namong the records of his letters: Third, by their want of dates:\\r\\nFourth, by the fact that his intimate friend and biographer, Chief\\r\\nJustice Marshall,[81] (himself a Mason in his youth,) says that he\\r\\nnever heard Washington utter a syllable on the subject, a matter\\r\\nnearly impossible, if Washington had for years been engaged in\\r\\nwriting laudatory letters to the Grand Lodges of South Carolina,\\r\\nPennsylvania, and Massachusetts.\"[82]\\n\\xa0\\nThe movement to elect General Washington a [Pg 134]Grand Master over all the\\r\\nBrethren in the United States originated at a meeting of American Union\\r\\nLodge, held at the encampment of the American Army at Morristown, New\\r\\nJersey, December 15, 1779. This Lodge was a Regimental Lodge of the\\r\\nConnecticut Line, originally warranted by the Provincial Grand Master of\\r\\nMassachusetts.\\nThis movement continued to find favor amongst the craft, especially in\\r\\nPennsylvania, and culminated in a motion to that effect at a General\\r\\nGrand Communication of the Grand Lodge, December 20, 1779.\\nThis resulted in a Grand Lodge of Emergency being convened January 13,\\r\\n1780, when the following action was taken:[83]\\n\"This Lodge being called by Order of the Grand Master, upon the\\r\\nrequest of Sundry Brethren, and also in pursuance of a Motion made\\r\\nat the last General Communication, to consider the Propriety as\\r\\nwell as the necessity of appointing a Grand Master over all the\\r\\nGrand Lodges formed or to be formed in these United States, as the\\r\\nCorrespondence which the Rules of Masonry require cannot now be\\r\\ncarried on with the Grand Lodge of London, under whose Jurisdiction\\r\\nthe Grand Lodges in these States were originally constituted; The\\r\\nBallot was put upon the Question: Whether it be for the Benefit of\\r\\nMasonry that \\'a Grand Master of Masons thro\\'out the[Pg 135] United States\\'\\r\\nshall be now nominated on the part of this Grand Lodge; and it was\\r\\nunanimously determined in the affirmative.\\n\"Sundry respectable Brethren being then put in nomination, it was\\r\\nmoved that the Ballot be put for them separately, and His\\r\\nExcellency George Washington, Esquire, General and\\r\\nCommander-in-chief of the Armies of the United States being first\\r\\nin nomination, he was ballotted for accordingly as Grand Master,\\r\\nand Elected by the unanimous vote of the whole Lodge.\\n\"Ordered, That the minutes of this Election and appointment be\\r\\ntransmitted to the different Grand Lodges in the United States, and\\r\\ntheir Concurrence therein be requested, in Order that application\\r\\nbe made to his Excellency in due form, praying that he will do the\\r\\nBrethren and Craft the honor of accepting their appointment. A\\r\\nCommittee was appointed to expedite the Business.\"\\n\\xa0\\nThe movement was further advanced at a Convention of representatives of\\r\\nthe Army Lodges, held at Morristown, N. J., on February 7, 1780, when,\\r\\nfortified by the pronounced action of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, a\\r\\ncommittee was chosen of which Brother Mordecai Gist of Maryland was\\r\\nchairman and Brother Otho Williams of Delaware, secretary.[84]\\n\\xa0\\n[Pg 136]\\n\\nFac-simile of Final Letter from Boston, Ending the Attempt to make Gen.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n'"

In this collection, were also found some of the\\noriginal drafts of <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\'s replies, together with copies of the\\nvarious masonic addresses and letters to him, and in the case of Dominie\\nSnyder, press copies of his answers.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the present work an attempt has been made to group this matter\\ntogether in chronological order, also to show some of the surroundings\\nand conditions under which this correspondence was made, and of the\\nBrethren who were prominent in the presentation<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_2\" name=\"Page_2\">[Pg 2]</a></span> of these Eleven\\nAddresses, which came to him from Seven of the Thirteen Colonies.</p>\\n\\n<p>A complete set of photostatic fac-similes of these documents in the\\nLibrary of Congress, has been secured for the Museum of the Grand Lodge\\nof Pennsylvania. Efforts were also made to obtain photographic copies of\\nsuch of the <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> Masonic letters as were still in existence, which\\nwere successful except in two instances as noted in the text.</p>\\n\\n<p>It will be noted that on April 30, 1789, <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>, while Master of his\\nLodge, was inaugurated President of the United States; this is the only\\ninstance where one of the fourteen Presidents, who were Members of our\\nFraternity was a Master of a Lodge during their term as President.</p>\\n\\n<p>The esteem in which <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> held the Masonic Fraternity, is shown by\\nthe fact, that in almost every case he had both the address and his\\nreply, copied upon opposite pages of one of his folio letter-books, now\\nin the Library of Congress. These copies are respectively in the\\nhandwriting of <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\'s private secretaries, viz:—Major William\\nJackson: Tobias Lear: Bartholomew Dandridge and G. W. Craik.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to the above copies we have <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\'s original drafts of\\nhis letters to Watson and Cassoul, to the Grand Lodges of Massachusetts,\\nSouth Carolina, and Maryland, to Paul Revere, and<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_3\" name=\"Page_3\">[Pg 3]</a></span> as before stated\\npress copies of his answers to Mr. Snyder.</p>\\n\\n<p>A perusal of these original documents, as here presented, affords an\\nexcellent illustration of the <i>entente cordiale</i>, which existed between\\n<span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> and his Masonic Brethren.</p>\\n\\n<p>Upon the other hand, how the Masonic Fraternity, during <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\'s\\nlifetime, venerated their august Brother, is shown by the addresses of\\nthis correspondence as retained by <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also by the various Masonic Memorial services held, after <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\'s\\ndeath, the chief of which was in Philadelphia, under the auspices of the\\nGrand Lodge of Pennsylvania. The Masonic services held in every State of\\nthe Union, the many Eulogies and Sermons delivered and printed are\\nmatters of history.</p>\\n\\n<p>How this veneration of the great <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> continued during the past\\nyears, is shown by the fact that there are no less than 53 Masonic\\nLodges in the United States, named after the illustrious Brother. This\\nis independent of the numerous Royal Arch Chapters, Commanderies, and\\nother Masonic bodies, that bear the name \"<span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Washington Lodges are found in thirty-eight of the forty-eight States of\\nthe American Union.</p>\\n\\n<p>The other ten States, which thus far have no \"Washington Lodge\" within\\ntheir Jurisdiction, are Mississippi and Texas, together with the newer\\nwestern States lately admitted into the American Union,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_4\" name=\"Page_4\">[Pg 4]</a></span> viz:—Nevada,\\nNorth Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to the fifty-three Washington Lodges, there is also one each\\nin Canada, the Island of Cuba and the District of Columbia.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the Masonic Fraternity throughout the world, the name of <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\nis ever kept in remembrance, as one of the brightest luminaries in the\\nMasonic constellation, one of the most prominent examples, being his\\nfull length oil portrait in Masonic clothing in the Hall of the Grand\\nLodge of England at London.</p>\\n\\n<p>Acknowledgments are due to the Hon. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of\\nCongress, for placing these documents at the disposal of the writer, and\\ngiving permission to have photostat copies made of same; also to J.\\nHenry Williams, Esq., R. W. Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania and\\nMasonic Jurisdiction thereunto belonging, for suggestions and\\nencouragement in the preparation of this work.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"figcenter\"><img alt=\"Julius F.

Thus far no complete set of his Masonic\\nwritings have been compiled or published. Such portions as have been\\nprinted were fragmentary, and issued for what may be called local\\npurposes.</p>\\n\\n<p>How careful <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> was of his Masonic correspondence is shown by the\\nfact that he had copies made, in his private letter books, of most all\\nletters sent him by the various Masonic Grand and Subordinate bodies,\\nand his answers thereto, usually upon opposite pages. He thus had both\\nthe addresses and his reply at hand for easy reference. This fact shows\\nthe esteem in which <span class=\"smcap\">Washington<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_6\" name=\"Page_6\">[Pg 6]</a></span></span> held his Brethren of the Masonic\\nFraternity, as well as his own opinion of Freemasonry.</p>\\n\\n<p>These letter-books are now in the Library of Congress, and photostat\\ncopies of such as relate to Freemasonry have been made for the Library\\nof the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.</p>\\n\\n<p>As to the authenticity of the Washington Letter Books, and how they came\\ninto the possession of the United States Government is explained by the\\nfollowing statement by Mr. Galliard Hunt, chief Manuscript division,\\nLibrary of Congress:<small><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29949/29949-h/29949-h.htm#f1\" id=\"f1.1\" name=\"f1.1\">[1]</a></small></p>\\n\\n<div class=\"letter\">\\n\"They are a part of the Washington papers in<br />\\n\"the Government\\'s possession, purchased from the<br />\\n\"Washington family, one lot in 1834 and the re-<br />\\n\"mainder in 1849, and deposited in the Department<br />\\n\"of State until 1903, when, by the President\\'s order,<br />\\n\"they were sent to this Library. They range in date<br />\\n\"from 1754 to 1799. Some of them are partly<br />\\n\"or wholly in Washington\\'s hand-writing, and others<br />\\n\"in the writing of his secretaries and their clerks.<br />\\n\"There are no volumes of press copies, but there are<br />\\n\"some press copies among the papers.\"</div>\\n\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> in writing his answer to the various greetings, in most cases\\nwould first make a rough copy of his reply, then digest, alter, correct\\nor change such parts or sentences as he thought proper. Then <span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_7\" name=\"Page_7\">[Pg 7]</a></span>after\\ndeliberate consideration, a fair copy would be made either by <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\nor one of his Secretaries and signed by him, and sent to the Masonic\\nbodies for which they were intended.</p>\\n\\n<p>Fortunately some of the original drafts of these Masonic letters have\\ncome down to us; thus far five autographic copies have been found among\\nthe Washington papers in the Library of Congress at Washington.</p>\\n\\n<p>1. Draft of letter written at Newburg, New York, August 19, 1782, to\\nWatson and Cassoul of Nantes, France, thanking them for the Masonic\\nApron, embroidered by the nuns at Nantes, and which is now in possession\\nof Alexandria-Washington Lodge, No. 22, at Alexandria, Virginia.</p>\\n\\n<p>2. To the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts.</p>\\n\\n<p>3. To the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.</p>\\n\\n<p>4. To the Grand Lodge of South Carolina.</p>\\n\\n<p>5. To the Grand Lodge of Maryland; this draft is a two-page letter\\nwritten upon a letter sheet and shows many changes and corrections; it\\nis dated 1798.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to the above original drafts there were found several\\naddresses and the accompanying answers, which thus far have never been\\npublished, in fact no mention of them has ever appeared in print, viz:—</p>\\n\\n<p>1. An address from the Grand Lodge of Georgia, together with\\n<span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\'s reply.</p>\\n\\n<p><span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_8\" name=\"Page_8\">[Pg 8]</a></span>2. A letter to Paul Revere, Grand Master of Massachusetts and his Grand\\nOfficers.</p>\\n\\n<p>3. An address from the Brethren of Prince George\\'s Lodge, No. 16,\\nGeorgetown, South Carolina, presented to President <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> during his\\nvisit to South Carolina, April 30, 1791, also his reply to same.</p>\\n\\n<p>4. An address from the Brethren of St. John\\'s Lodge, No. 2, of Newbern,\\nNorth Carolina, and the reply to same.</p>\\n\\n<p>Photostat copies of the above have also been obtained which make the\\nmost complete collection of the Masonic Correspondence of <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\nwhich has thus far been compiled.</p>\\n\\n<p>A careful study of this correspondence so carefully cherished by\\n<span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> puts an entirely new phase upon <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>\\'s connection with\\nthe Masonic Fraternity, and his esteem of Freemasonry.</p>\\n\\n<p>These papers absolutely thrust aside all of the statements, arguments\\nand libels, brought forth by our misguided enemies at the time of the\\nAnti-Masonic craze during the last century, and in a small way kept\\nalive even down to the present day by some people who are blinded by\\ntheir ignorance or malice.</p>\\n\\n<p>Referring to some of their published statements that <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> never\\nbelonged to the Masonic Fraternity, and that there were no authentic\\nMasonic letters nor copies thereof among his records so fre<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_9\" name=\"Page_9\">[Pg 9]</a></span>quently made\\nduring the political Anti-Masonic craze, which swept over New England\\nand the Middle States about eighty-five years ago, the following\\nquotations from the Masonic literature of the period will prove\\ninteresting examples.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of the chief statements made by these people, and brought before all\\ntheir conventions and heralded in the public prints was: \"That though\\nGeneral Washington caused to be carefully copied in books kept for that\\npurpose, all his letters on every subject, no trace whatever of any of\\nthe five letters under consideration,<small><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29949/29949-h/29949-h.htm#f2\" id=\"f2.1\" name=\"f2.1\">[2]</a></small> nor any letters to any other\\nLodge or Masonic body whatever, are to be found among the records of his\\ncorrespondence.\"<small><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29949/29949-h/29949-h.htm#f3\" id=\"f3.1\" name=\"f3.1\">[3]</a></small></p>\\n\\n<p>The chief authority upon whom the leaders of the Anti-Masonic movement\\nat that time depended in their defamation of <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>, was Jared\\nSparks of Boston, who at the time was engaged writing a life of\\n<span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span>, and then had access to all the Washington letter-books and\\npapers, and from his connection with the Washington correspondence, was\\n<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_10\" name=\"Page_10\">[Pg 10]</a></span>supposed to be the best qualified to pass upon their authenticity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another of the charges made by the Anti-Masonic bigots whose chief\\nobject was to controvert facts was:</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"blockquot\"><p>\"That although <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> was <i>extremely scrupulous</i> in preserving\\nhis correspondence with all public or private bodies, there is not\\na line of his <i>relating to Freemasonry</i>, to be found among all his\\npapers, except the correspondence with Mr. Snyder!<small><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29949/29949-h/29949-h.htm#f4\" id=\"f4.1\" name=\"f4.1\">[4]</a></small> It is also a\\nfact, that <span class=\"smcap\">Washington</span> was equally scrupulous in dating his letters,\\nand it is believed that not one can be found, which is without a\\ndate.\"<small><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29949/29949-h/29949-h.htm#f5\" id=\"f5.1\" name=\"f5.1\">[5]</a></small></p></div>\\n\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>It appears that the chairman of a committee of citizens of Boston called\\nupon the officers of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to submit their\\ntwo Washington letters to Jared Sparks for his inspection.

The main point of their argument was that it bore no\\ndate and therefore was not authentic.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\xa0</p><p><a id=\"vernon\" name=\"vernon\"></a></p>\\n<div class=\"figcenter\"><img alt=\"MOUNT VERNON\" src=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29949/29949-h/images/i131.jpg\" /></div>\\n<div class=\"caption\">MOUNT VERNON<br />\\n<small>DURING WASHINGTON\\'S OCCUPANCY, 1788-1799.</small></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xa0</p><p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><span class=\"u\">Footnotes:</span></p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29949/29949-h/29949-h.htm#f58.1\" id=\"f58\" name=\"f58\">[58]</a> Cf.

In this collection, were also found some of theoriginal drafts of Washington\\'s replies, together with copies of thevarious masonic addresses and letters to him, and in the case of DominieSnyder, press copies of his answers.In the present work an attempt has been made to group this mattertogether in chronological order, also to show some of the surroundingsand conditions under which this correspondence was made, and of theBrethren who were prominent in the presentation[Pg 2] of these ElevenAddresses, which came to him from Seven of the Thirteen Colonies.A complete set of photostatic fac-similes of these documents in theLibrary of Congress, has been secured for the Museum of the Grand Lodgeof Pennsylvania. Efforts were also made to obtain photographic copies ofsuch of the Washington Masonic letters as were still in existence, whichwere successful except in two instances as noted in the text.It will be noted that on April 30, 1789, Washington, while Master of hisLodge, was inaugurated President of the United States; this is the onlyinstance where one of the fourteen Presidents, who were Members of ourFraternity was a Master of a Lodge during their term as President.The esteem in which Washington held the Masonic Fraternity, is shown bythe fact, that in almost every case he had both the address and hisreply, copied upon opposite pages of one of his folio letter-books, nowin the Library of Congress. These copies are respectively in thehandwriting of Washington\\'s private secretaries, viz:—Major WilliamJackson: Tobias Lear: Bartholomew Dandridge and G. W. Craik.In addition to the above copies we have Washington\\'s original drafts ofhis letters to Watson and Cassoul, to the Grand Lodges of Massachusetts,South Carolina, and Maryland, to Paul Revere, and[Pg 3] as before statedpress copies of his answers to Mr. Snyder.A perusal of these original documents, as here presented, affords anexcellent illustration of the entente cordiale, which existed betweenWashington and his Masonic Brethren.Upon the other hand, how the Masonic Fraternity, during Washington\\'slifetime, venerated their august Brother, is shown by the addresses ofthis correspondence as retained by Washington.Also by the various Masonic Memorial services held, after Washington\\'sdeath, the chief of which was in Philadelphia, under the auspices of theGrand Lodge of Pennsylvania. The Masonic services held in every State ofthe Union, the many Eulogies and Sermons delivered and printed arematters of history.How this veneration of the great Washington continued during the pastyears, is shown by the fact that there are no less than 53 MasonicLodges in the United States, named after the illustrious Brother. Thisis independent of the numerous Royal Arch Chapters, Commanderies, andother Masonic bodies, that bear the name \"Washington.\"Washington Lodges are found in thirty-eight of the forty-eight States ofthe American Union.The other ten States, which thus far have no \"Washington Lodge\" withintheir Jurisdiction, are Mississippi and Texas, together with the newerwestern States lately admitted into the American Union,[Pg 4] viz:—Nevada,North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.In addition to the fifty-three Washington Lodges, there is also one eachin Canada, the Island of Cuba and the District of Columbia.In the Masonic Fraternity throughout the world, the name of Washingtonis ever kept in remembrance, as one of the brightest luminaries in theMasonic constellation, one of the most prominent examples, being hisfull length oil portrait in Masonic clothing in the Hall of the GrandLodge of England at London.Acknowledgments are due to the Hon. Herbert Putnam, Librarian ofCongress, for placing these documents at the disposal of the writer, andgiving permission to have photostat copies made of same; also to J.Henry Williams, Esq., R. W. Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania andMasonic Jurisdiction thereunto belonging, for suggestions andencouragement in the preparation of this work.Philadelphia, February 22, A.D. 1915—A.L. 5915.[Pg 5]The Masonic Correspondenceof WashingtonMuch has been written pro and con about Washington and his connectionwith the Masonic Fraternity. Thus far no complete set of his Masonicwritings have been compiled or published. Such portions as have beenprinted were fragmentary, and issued for what may be called localpurposes.How careful Washington was of his Masonic correspondence is shown by thefact that he had copies made, in his private letter books, of most allletters sent him by the various Masonic Grand and Subordinate bodies,and his answers thereto, usually upon opposite pages. He thus had boththe addresses and his reply at hand for easy reference. This fact showsthe esteem in which Washington[Pg 6] held his Brethren of the MasonicFraternity, as well as his own opinion of Freemasonry.These letter-books are now in the Library of Congress, and photostatcopies of such as relate to Freemasonry have been made for the Libraryof the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.As to the authenticity of the Washington Letter Books, and how they cameinto the possession of the United States Government is explained by thefollowing statement by Mr. Galliard Hunt, chief Manuscript division,Library of Congress:[1]\"They are a part of the Washington papers in\"the Government\\'s possession, purchased from the\"Washington family, one lot in 1834 and the re-\"mainder in 1849, and deposited in the Department\"of State until 1903, when, by the President\\'s order,\"they were sent to this Library. They range in date\"from 1754 to 1799. Some of them are partly\"or wholly in Washington\\'s hand-writing, and others\"in the writing of his secretaries and their clerks.\"There are no volumes of press copies, but there are\"some press copies among the papers.\"Washington in writing his answer to the various greetings, in most caseswould first make a rough copy of his reply, then digest, alter, corrector change such parts or sentences as he thought proper. Then [Pg 7]afterdeliberate consideration, a fair copy would be made either by Washingtonor one of his Secretaries and signed by him, and sent to the Masonicbodies for which they were intended.Fortunately some of the original drafts of these Masonic letters havecome down to us; thus far five autographic copies have been found amongthe Washington papers in the Library of Congress at Washington.1. Draft of letter written at Newburg, New York, August 19, 1782, toWatson and Cassoul of Nantes, France, thanking them for the MasonicApron, embroidered by the nuns at Nantes, and which is now in possessionof Alexandria-Washington Lodge, No. 22, at Alexandria, Virginia.2. To the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts.3. To the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.4. To the Grand Lodge of South Carolina.5. To the Grand Lodge of Maryland; this draft is a two-page letterwritten upon a letter sheet and shows many changes and corrections; itis dated 1798.In addition to the above original drafts there were found severaladdresses and the accompanying answers, which thus far have never beenpublished, in fact no mention of them has ever appeared in print, viz:—1. An address from the Grand Lodge of Georgia, together withWashington\\'s reply.[Pg 8]2. A letter to Paul Revere, Grand Master of Massachusetts and his GrandOfficers.3. An address from the Brethren of Prince George\\'s Lodge, No. 16,Georgetown, South Carolina, presented to President Washington during hisvisit to South Carolina, April 30, 1791, also his reply to same.4. An address from the Brethren of St. John\\'s Lodge, No. 2, of Newbern,North Carolina, and the reply to same.Photostat copies of the above have also been obtained which make themost complete collection of the Masonic Correspondence of Washingtonwhich has thus far been compiled.A careful study of this correspondence so carefully cherished byWashington puts an entirely new phase upon Washington\\'s connection withthe Masonic Fraternity, and his esteem of Freemasonry.These papers absolutely thrust aside all of the statements, argumentsand libels, brought forth by our misguided enemies at the time of theAnti-Masonic craze during the last century, and in a small way keptalive even down to the present day by some people who are blinded bytheir ignorance or malice.Referring to some of their published statements that Washington neverbelonged to the Masonic Fraternity, and that there were no authenticMasonic letters nor copies thereof among his records so fre[Pg 9]quently madeduring the political Anti-Masonic craze, which swept over New Englandand the Middle States about eighty-five years ago, the followingquotations from the Masonic literature of the period will proveinteresting examples.One of the chief statements made by these people, and brought before alltheir conventions and heralded in the public prints was: \"That thoughGeneral Washington caused to be carefully copied in books kept for thatpurpose, all his letters on every subject, no trace whatever of any ofthe five letters under consideration,[2] nor any letters to any otherLodge or Masonic body whatever, are to be found among the records of hiscorrespondence.\"[3]The chief authority upon whom the leaders of the Anti-Masonic movementat that time depended in their defamation of Washington, was JaredSparks of Boston, who at the time was engaged writing a life ofWashington, and then had access to all the Washington letter-books andpapers, and from his connection with the Washington correspondence, was[Pg 10]supposed to be the best qualified to pass upon their authenticity.Another of the charges made by the Anti-Masonic bigots whose chiefobject was to controvert facts was:\"That although Washington was extremely scrupulous in preservinghis correspondence with all public or private bodies, there is nota line of his relating to Freemasonry, to be found among all hispapers, except the correspondence with Mr. Snyder![4] It is also afact, that Washington was equally scrupulous in dating his letters,and it is believed that not one can be found, which is without adate.\"[5]It appears that the chairman of a committee of citizens of Boston calledupon the officers of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to submit theirtwo Washington letters to Jared Sparks for his inspection. This theGrand Officers refused to do.In return Sparks sent the following letter to the Chairman:\"Boston, February 18, 1833.\"Sir,—I received this morning your letter of the 15th instant,in which you inquire:\"Whether I have yet seen or had in my possession[Pg 11] any originalletter or letters, in the hand writing of General Washington,addressed to any body of men denominating themselves Freemasons.\"In reply, I can only state that I have seen no letters fromGeneral Washington of the kind described in yours, nor received anycommunication on the subject, either verbal or written.[6]\"I am, Sir,\"Very respectfully,\"Your ob\\'t servant,\"Jared Sparks.\"How Sparks could have overlooked the numerous entries in the letterbooks whose numbers and folios are here quoted, also the drafts ofreplies in Washington\\'s hand-writing and signed by him (copies of whichare here given in this work), can only be accounted for by the fact thathe must have been carried away by the political excitement of the day.Washington\\'s connection with the Masonic Fraternity has beenexhaustively traced by Brother James M. Lamberton, Past Master ofPerseverance Lodge, No. 21, in his address \"Washington as a Freemason,\"from the day of his entrance into Fredericksburg Lodge, No. 4, ofVirginia, September 1, 1752, until the day of his death, December 14,1799, before the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, at its celebration of theSesqui-Centennial [Pg 12]Anniversary of the Initiation of Brother GeorgeWashington into the Fraternity of Freemasons,[7] held in the MasonicTemple, in the city of Philadelphia on Wednesday, November 5, 1902.It must also be remembered that Washington made a public profession ofhis membership in Philadelphia, Monday, December 28, 1778, when hewalked in procession with his brethren of the Grand Lodge ofPennsylvania, from the College at Fourth and Arch Streets to ChristChurch on Second Street above Market Street, Philadelphia, where, aftera prayer by Rev. William White, a sermon was preached for the \"[Benefitof the POOR] by appointment of and before | The General Communication |of | Free and Accepted | MASONS | of the | State of PENNSYLVANIA, | onMonday, December 28, 1788, | Celebrated, agreeable to theirConstitution, | as the Anniversary of | ST. JOHN the Evangelist, | byWilliam Smith, D.D., | Provost of the College and Academy ofPhiladelphia.\" |This Sermon was printed and dedicated to Brother Washington and a copysent to him, which was bound with other pamphlets in a volume lettered\"Masonic Sermons,\" and is so mentioned in the inventory of his estateand now in the Boston Athe[Pg 13]næum.[8] Atthis service over four hundred pounds were collected for the relief of the poor.Rev. Brother William Smith, D.D., preached a number of Masonic Sermonsin Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland; three of which delivered at therequest of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania were printed, viz.:Sermon 1.—On Brotherly Love, &c. Preached on the Anniversary of St.John the Baptist, June 24, 1755,Sermon 2.—Preached on Monday, December 28, 1778, celebrated as theAnniversary of St. John the Evangelist. With an Appendix on theCharacter of Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus,Sermon 3.—Preached before the Grand Lodge of Communication, on St.John the Baptist\\'s day, June 24, 1795.Original copies of the above are in the Library of the Grand Lodge ofPennsylvania.Rev. Brother Smith reprinted the above in a Volume of Sermons with thefollowing note:[9]\"N. B. The above three Sermons were preached at the request of the GrandLodge of Communication, for Pennsylvania, and contains in substance allthat the Author thinks it necessary to bequeath to [Pg 14]the Brotherhood, byway of Sermons, preached at different times and in sundry of theneighboring States, during 48 Years past.\"By referring to the following letters and Documents it is shown thatWashington\\'s interest in Freemasonry and the Fraternity continued untilthe time of his death.These documents cover the period from 1782 to 1798.As these copies in our possession are photostat fac-similes of theoriginal documents in the Library of Congress, there can never be anyquestion of correctness or of their authenticity.The finding and collating of this material will settle for all time tocome the question of Washington\\'s connection with the AncientFraternity, and his opinion and esteem of Freemasonry.The earliest record we have of any Masonic Body proposing a masonicaddress to General Washington, was the resolution offered in KingDavid\\'s Lodge, No. 1, at Newport, Rhode Island, during Washington\\'svisit to Newport in March, 1781, while the French Army under Rochambeauwas quartered there. Washington arrived in Newport on the sixth of Marchand remained there until the thirteenth, when he left for Providence byway of Bristol.It was in anticipation of this visit that the Brethren of King David\\'sLodge, of which Brother Moses[Pg 15] Michael Hays[10] was Worshipful Master,that a masonic greeting to General Washington was proposed.

They were executed in a superiorand expensive style. We transmitted them to America, accompanied byan appropriate address.\"By the above extract is shown beyond all doubt the error in thestatement so repeatedly made, that the apron at Alexandria is the onemade by the Marquise de Lafayette, and presented to Washington byGeneral Lafayette, during his visit to Mount Vernon in 1784, and the onein the Museum of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, that of Watson andCassoul.[14]Following letter was sent to Washington, together with the Masonic Apronand \"Ornaments,\" by Messrs.

Original in Alexandria-Washington Lodge, No. 22, Alexandria, Virginia.[Pg 32]It appears that during his residence at Annapolis, he was made a Masonin a clandestine or irregular Lodge, and in the year 1783 applied for adispensation from the Grand Master of Pennsylvania, to apply to LodgeNo. 2, for initiation and membership.Brother Dr. Elisha Cullen Dick, Senior Warden of Lodge No. 39, was anative of Pennsylvania, born near Marcus Hook, in Delaware County, about1753, and died at Alexandria, Va., September 22, 1825.

As no fac-simile copy wasobtainable, an engrossed copy for same was substituted in the collectionof Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.This banquet was held at Wise\\'s tavern[25] and was participated in byWashington, who upon this festive occasion was elected an honoraryMember of Lodge No. 39, upon the Pennsylvania register, and thus becamea Pennsylvania Freemason, and his name is duly recorded as such upon theminutes of Lodge No. 39.This fact further contradicts the Anti-Masonic[Pg 36] arguments based upon theSnyder letter so extensively used during the years 1826-1833, thatWashington never belonged to any Masonic Lodge, after his initiation inthe Fredericksburg Lodge in 1752.The above note as recorded upon the Minutes of Alexandria Lodge, No. 39,shows that Washington was in complete harmony with the MasonicFraternity; further, that by his acceptance of membership, Washingtonbecame a Pennsylvania Mason.Among the cherished relics in the Alexandria Lodge, there is none morevaluable than the Masonic portrait of Brother Washington, which formsthe frontispiece of this volume. This was painted from life in pastel,by William Williams, at Philadelphia in 1794.In the year 1910 a fac-simile of this portrait was made in oil by MissFanny M. Burke, an artist of repute, and a great-granddaughter of ThomasJefferson.

It was MosesSeixas who addressed a letter of welcome in the [Pg 40]name of the Jewishcongregation to George Washington when the latter visited Newport, andit was to him that Washington\\'s answer was addressed.The Town Hall at Newport being out of repair at that time the ancientJewish Synagogue on the main street was used, upon that and severalother public occasions. It is an interesting fact that this sacrededifice is still preserved in the same condition as it was during theColonial period.So far as known this address was the first of Masonic import made toWashington as President.

Further, thatWashington kept more or less in touch with [Pg 87]his Masonic Brethren of theGrand Lodge of Pennsylvania is shown by the fact that he attended theservices at St. Paul\\'s Episcopal Church, on Third Street below Walnut,on St. John\\'s Day, December 27, 1793, where a charity sermon waspreached by Rev.

The committee appointed to perform this dutywere Brothers William Smith, Peter Le Barbier Duplessis and ThomasProcter, who, after having waited on him, reported that he had appointedto-morrow, December 28, 1796, at twelve o\\'clock to receive it.

Original in Archives of the Grand Lodge ofPennsylvania.[Pg 93]Brother William Moore Smith, Right Worshipful Grand Master ofPennsylvania, whose first official act as Grand Master was to head thecommittee to call on the President, was a son of the Rev. William Smith,D.D., born in Philadelphia, June 1, 1759. He was a lawyer by professionand served as Deputy Grand Master for the year 1795 under the VenerableWilliam Ball, and as Right Worshipful Grand Master for the years1796-1797. He was appointed by the President as agent for the settlementof claims that were provided for in the Sixth Article of John Jay\\'sTreaty, and visited England in 1803 to close the commission. He died atthe Smith Homestead at Falls of Schuylkill, March 12, 1821.Both the address and reply were copied in Washington\\'s Letter Book III,pp. 244-245, in the handwriting of one of his secretaries, G. W. Craik,a son of Dr. James Craik, Washington\\'s \"compatriot in arms, and old andintimate friend,\" who attended him during his last illness.Photostat copies of above are in the Library of the Grand Lodge ofPennsylvania, also the original draft of the address, presented to thePresident (Mss. Volume A, folio 23).This autograph Masonic letter from Washington to the Grand Lodge ofPennsylvania has been reproduced in fac-simile, published and circulated(in most cases without the knowledge or consent of the Grand Lodge ofPennsylvania) more widely than[Pg 94] any other known letter of Washington.Some of these copies are treasured by their owners under the impressionthat they have the original letter. Several cases of this kind have oflate come under the notice of the writer. In one case where one of thesereproductions was offered for sale, hundreds of dollars were asked forthe reproduction, and it was with great difficulty that the owner couldbe convinced of its character.Another use made of this letter by unprincipled persons was to make aphoto-lithographic copy of the letter, and substitute the name ofanother state for that of Pennsylvania, and then palm it off upon theauthorities of that state as an original letter to their Grand Lodge.The latest case of this kind known to the writer is that of the GrandLodge of Georgia, who were thus imposed upon.Then again the letter has been extensively used for advertising purposesby publishing houses of Masonic literature.The letter has also been printed in most all books bearing upon Masonichistory during the revolutionary period.It was also frequently quoted and criticised during the Anti-Masoniccraze which swept over the country some eighty-odd years ago, it beingthe chief Masonic letter of the five known to the leaders of thosemisguided persons. The main point of their argument was that it bore nodate and therefore was not authentic.MOUNT VERNONDURING WASHINGTON\\'S OCCUPANCY, 1788-1799.Footnotes:[58] Cf.

Snyder to Washington, August 22, 1798.[Pg 122]Fac-simile of Fourth Page of Letter from G. W. Snyder to Washington, August 22, 1798.FAC-SIMILE OF PRESS COPY OF WASHINGTON\\'S ANSWER TO REV. G. W. SNYDER.—SEPTEMBER 25, 1798.[Pg 123]This man Snyder (Schneider) was an agitator and thoroughly irresponsibleperson, having no ecclesiastical connection with any organized ChurchBody.In the year 1787, Schneider came from Albany, New York, to Frederick,ostensibly to collect money to build a Church. He was kindly receivedand permitted to preach in the Reformed Congregation, where he soonfomented discord and trouble.Schneider was soon driven out of Frederick Town, but returned again in1794, when he renewed the trouble in the Church, which ended in aschism. The matter finally got into the Civil Court, and on February 15,1800 the case was decided against him, which ended his activity inFrederick Town; soon after which he left for parts unknown.[67]Snyder, who was not a native of this country, evidently labored underthe impression that Washington was a Grand Master General, who presidedover all of the English (or Symbolic) Masonic Lodges in the UnitedStates. Snyder evidently used the term \"English\" Lodges, to distinguishthem from the Masonic bodies working in the so-called higher (Scotch)degrees, as are now known as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.How important Washington considered this correspondence is shown by hisprecaution in taking a press copy of both of his letters to Snyder, whohe [Pg 124]was led to believe was the regular pastor of the German ReformedCongregation at Fredericktown. These are now in the Library of Congress.It will be noted that in all of his other Masonic correspondence, copieswere made in his regular letter books by his clerks, of both address andreply. Brother Washington evidently surmised that this letter fromSnyder was nothing more or less than a scheme to entrap him. It was notuntil a month had elapsed, and then only after due consideration, thatthe following reply was sent to Fredericktown, viz.:\"Mount Vernon, 25th Sept. 1798.\"Sir,\"Many apologies are\"due to you, for my not acknowledging\"the receipt of your obliging favour offor\"the 22d ult, and ^ not thanking you, at\"an earlier period for the Book you\"had the goodness to send me.\"I have heard much of the ne-\"farious & dangerous plan, & doctrines\"of the Illuminati, but never saw the\"Book until you were pleased to send\"it to me. The same causes which\"have prevented my acknowledging the\"receipt of your letter, have prevented\"my reading the Book, hitherto, name-[Pg 125]\"ly, the multiplicity of matters whichme\"pressed upon before, & the debilitated\"state in which I was left after a se\"vere fever had been removed, and\"which allows me to add little more now,\"than thanks for your kind wishes and\"favourable sentiments, except to cor-\"rect an error you have run into, of my\"presiding over the English Lodges in\"this Country. The fact is, I preside over\"none, nor have I been in one, more thanthirty\"once or twice, within the last years.\"I believe notwithstanding, that\"none of the Lodges in this Country are\"contaminated with the principles as-\"cribed to the society of the Illuminati.\"\"With respect\"I am, Sir,\"Your Obedt Hble Servt\"The Revd Mr Snyder.Endorsedto\"The Revd Mr. Snyder.\"25th Sep. 1798.\"FAC-SIMILE OF PRESS COPY OF WASHINGTON\\'S SECOND LETTER TO REV. G. W. SNYDER.—OCTOBER 24, 1798.[Pg 126]In this letter Washington was correct in stating that he had notpresided over the \"English Lodges in this Country,\" undoubtedly meaningas Grand Master General.Where Washington says \"The fact is I preside over none,\" he meant thathe did not then preside over any individual lodge, as he at that timewas a Past Master of Alexandria Lodge, No. 22, of Virginia.[68]Where he says \"Nor have I been in one, [meaning an individual lodge]more than once or twice within the last thirty years,\" he obviouslyhad in view his occasional visits to the various lodges during thatperiod, and that he could not, on account of his official duties andother conditions, attend any lodge regularly.As a matter of record, Washington was a member of Alexandria Lodge, No.39, of Pennsylvania,[69] and attended some of its meetings at Alexandriain 1783 and 1784, as is shown by the Minutes of the Lodge, and therecords here presented.[70] Further, that when the Brethren ofAlexandria Lodge, No. 39, changed their allegiance from Pennsylvania toVirginia, General Washington was especially named in the warrant, afterhis consent having been [Pg 127]first obtained,[71]and thereby became the Warrant Master of Lodge No. 22, under the Virginia jurisdiction, April28, 1788, serving as such until December 20 following, when, as theminutes of that date show,[72] he was unanimously elected to succeedhimself for the full term, serving in all about twenty months.The records further show that, in 1778, Washington occupied the chiefposition in the procession at the celebration of St. John the Evangelistby the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia in 1778, in whichmore than three hundred Brethren joined.[73]He also occupied the same position when he laid the corner stone of thepresent capitol at Washington, September 18, 1793, clothed with theMasonic Apron presented by Lafayette, which is now in the Museum of theGrand Lodge of Pennsylvania. Upon both of these occasions, Washingtonmade a public profession of his membership in the Masonic Fraternity.Records show that Washington was present at the meeting of AmericanUnion Lodge (a Military [Pg 128]Lodge), at Morristown, N. J., December 27,1779;[74] at American Union Lodge at Nelson\\'s point on the Hudson June24, 1782;[75] at King Solomon\\'s Lodge of Poughkeepsie, December 27,1782, and occasionally at Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, in 1783-1784, andthe Virginia Lodge, No. 22, between the years 1788 and 1797.[76]Washington in the next paragraph of his letter to Snyder makes hismeaning absolutely clear, that while he had not attended any Lodgeregularly during the past thirty years he plainly states: \"I believenotwithstanding, that none of the Lodges in this Country arecontaminated with the principles ascribed to the society of the Illuminati.\"This belief is further accentuated by the letter to the Grand Lodge ofMaryland a few weeks after the above letter was written to Snyder.In addition to above records, there are numerous traditions ofWashington\\'s occasional visits to Masonic Lodges and functions:[77] allof which fall within the thirty years mentioned in the SnyderLetter.[78]Further, Washington\\'s great interest in Free[Pg 129]masonry is shown by themany addresses received from different Grand and Subordinate Lodgesthroughout the Union, all of which he acknowledged in fraternal terms,also by the various Masonic constitutions and sermons dedicated to him,which he received with thanks and were preserved in his library.It will be noted that in the fifth line from the bottom, \"Within thelast thirty years,\" which in all Anti-Masonic publications is printedin italics, the word \"thirty\" was not in the body of the letter asoriginally written, but was an afterthought and interlined before the press copy was taken.In the press copy of this letter, it will be noted that the word writtenover the words \"last years,\" is almost indecipherable; in thephotostat it is completely so. This has led some investigators toquestion whether the interlined word is really \"thirty.\"The surmise that the blur in the press copy of[Pg 130] Washington\\'s letter toSnyder, was \"thirty\" was first promulgated by Jared Sparks, when hefurnished the text of the letter to the Anti-Masonic agitators, duringthe political excitement which swept over the New England States in thesecond decade of the nineteenth century.Snyder, upon receipt of this letter, undoubtedly after consultation withpersons who were politically opposed to Washington or antagonistic tothe Masonic Fraternity, wrote a second letter and sent it to MountVernon under date of October 17, 1798; no copy of this letter has thusfar been found among the Washington papers in the Library of Congress.Washington immediately sent the following sharp reply to Snyder, inwhich he plainly sets forth his belief that the Masonic Lodges in theUnited States were not interested in the propagation of the tenets ofwhat was then known as Jacobism or the Illuminati. The words asunderscored in the original letter by Washington were to emphasize hismeaning upon this subject.Photostats of both of the above letter press copies are in the Archivesof the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.\"Mount Vernon 24th Oct. 1798.\"Rev. Sir,\"I have you favor of thetive\"17th instant before me and my only mo:[Pg 131]\"to trouble you with the receipt of this let\"ter, is to explain, and correct a mistake\"which I perceive the hurry in which I\"am obliged, often to write letters, have\"led you into.—\"It was not my intention to doubt\"that, the doctrines of the Illuminati, and\"principles of Jacobism had not spread\"in the United States. On the contrary, no\"one is more, fully satisfied of this fact\"that I am.\"The idea I meant to convey, was,\"that I did not believe that the Lodges\"of Free Masons in this Country had, as\"Societies, endeavoured to propagate the\"diabolical tenets of the first, or the per-\"nicious principles of the latter, (if they\"are susceptible of separation) That\"individuals of them may have done it, or\"that the founder, or instrument employ\"ed to found the Democratic Societies\"in the United States, may have had these\"objects, and actually had a separation\"of the people from their Government\"in view, is too evident to be questioned.\"My occupations are such, that\"but little leisure is allowed me to read News\"Papers, or Books of any kind. The reading[Pg 132]\"of letters and preparing answers, absorb\"much of my time.—\"With respect,—I remain,\"Revd Sir,\"Your Most Obedt Hble Servt\"The Revd.\"Mr Snyder.\"Endorsedto\"The Revd Mr Snyder,\"24th Oct. 1798.\"It is a historical fact that Washington had always retained the highestrespect for the people of Maryland, and especially the citizens ofFrederick County. No man ever stood higher in the estimation of thepeople of Maryland than Washington, and his death awakened genuinesorrow. On February 22d, 1800, memorial services were observed in theReformed Church at Fredericktown.[79] It was a solemn day and the wholeCounty was in mourning; at which time Ex-Governor Thomas Johnsonpronounced the funeral oration. Snyder took no part in these services.The two letters to Snyder were chiefly relied upon by the Anti-Masons tosupport their political claims.[Pg 133]\"That Washington was never in a Lodge but twice, in his life; thathe paid no attention to Masonry during the war; that in 1781 hedeclined being addressed by Masons as a brother Mason, and in 1798was very particular to insist upon the fact that he had not been ina Lodge, but once or twice in 30 years, and knew nothing of theirprinciples and practices.\"[80]How false these statements so frequently made, is shown by the manyproofs here presented in fac-simile of the originals, which alsoabsolutely controvert the statement in Governor Ritner\\'s Vindication? viz:—\"That all the letters said to be written by Washington to Lodgesare spurious. This is rendered nearly certain: First, by thenon-production of the originals: Second, by the absence of copiesamong the records of his letters: Third, by their want of dates:Fourth, by the fact that his intimate friend and biographer, ChiefJustice Marshall,[81] (himself a Mason in his youth,) says that henever heard Washington utter a syllable on the subject, a matternearly impossible, if Washington had for years been engaged inwriting laudatory letters to the Grand Lodges of South Carolina,Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts.\"[82]The movement to elect General Washington a [Pg 134]Grand Master over all theBrethren in the United States originated at a meeting of American UnionLodge, held at the encampment of the American Army at Morristown, NewJersey, December 15, 1779. This Lodge was a Regimental Lodge of theConnecticut Line, originally warranted by the Provincial Grand Master ofMassachusetts.This movement continued to find favor amongst the craft, especially inPennsylvania, and culminated in a motion to that effect at a GeneralGrand Communication of the Grand Lodge, December 20, 1779.This resulted in a Grand Lodge of Emergency being convened January 13,1780, when the following action was taken:[83]\"This Lodge being called by Order of the Grand Master, upon therequest of Sundry Brethren, and also in pursuance of a Motion madeat the last General Communication, to consider the Propriety aswell as the necessity of appointing a Grand Master over all theGrand Lodges formed or to be formed in these United States, as theCorrespondence which the Rules of Masonry require cannot now becarried on with the Grand Lodge of London, under whose Jurisdictionthe Grand Lodges in these States were originally constituted; TheBallot was put upon the Question: Whether it be for the Benefit ofMasonry that \\'a Grand Master of Masons thro\\'out the[Pg 135] United States\\'shall be now nominated on the part of this Grand Lodge; and it wasunanimously determined in the affirmative.\"Sundry respectable Brethren being then put in nomination, it wasmoved that the Ballot be put for them separately, and HisExcellency George Washington, Esquire, General andCommander-in-chief of the Armies of the United States being firstin nomination, he was ballotted for accordingly as Grand Master,and Elected by the unanimous vote of the whole Lodge.\"Ordered, That the minutes of this Election and appointment betransmitted to the different Grand Lodges in the United States, andtheir Concurrence therein be requested, in Order that applicationbe made to his Excellency in due form, praying that he will do theBrethren and Craft the honor of accepting their appointment. ACommittee was appointed to expedite the Business.\"The movement was further advanced at a Convention of representatives ofthe Army Lodges, held at Morristown, N. J., on February 7, 1780, when,fortified by the pronounced action of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, acommittee was chosen of which Brother Mordecai Gist of Maryland waschairman and Brother Otho Williams of Delaware, secretary.[84][Pg 136]Fac-simile of Final Letter from Boston, Ending the Attempt to make Gen. Washington General Grand Master.[Pg 137]This Committee issued the celebrated address:\"To the RIGHT WORSHIPFUL, The Grand Masters of the several Lodgesin the Respective United States of America.\"UNION——FORCE——LOVE.\"This address was signed by representatives of no less than seven states,viz.: Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, MassachusettsBay, New York and Delaware; in addition to those of the American UnionLodge, Artillery, St. John\\'s Regimental Lodge and the Staff of theAmerican Army.It was further ordered that the foregoing address with an exact copy ofthese proceedings signed by the President and Secretary, be sent to therespective Provincial Grand Masters in the United States.[85]It was not until the middle of October that a reply was received fromthe Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to the circular letter sent out by theGrand Lodge of Pennsylvania, and then only in response to a letterwritten by our Grand Secretary, Rev. Brother Dr. William Smith.This matter led to more or less correspondence between the Grand Lodgesof Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and was in abeyance, until January,1781, when the following letter was received from Joseph Webb, GrandMaster of Massachusetts.[86][Pg 138]\"Boston, Jany 17, 1781.\"Revd Sir and\"Respected Brother\"Last Friday Evening the Grand Lodge met, agreeable to adjournmentand after a long debate on the subject, whether it was expedient atpresent to elect a Grand Master General for the United States, itpassed in the negative.\"Inclosed I transmit you the vote from the G. Sec\\'y.\"Yr Affecte Brother\"& Hble Servt\"Jos: Webb.\"Rev Dr Smith\"Philadelphia.\"The belief that Washington was the Grand Master of the United States waswidespread, and, as our late Bro. James M. Lamberton said in his addressbefore mentioned,[87] notwithstanding the fact that the project toelevate General Washington fell through, \"that the action of the ArmyLodges and of our Grand Lodge got abroad, is shown by translations oftwo letters from a Lodge at Cape Francois,[88] on the island of SanDomingo, directed to General Washington as Grand Master of all America,soliciting a charter, which were presented to our Grand Lodge, February3, 1786. The same [Pg 139]thing is shown by a medal struck in 1797, the obverseshowing the bust of Washington, with the legend, \"G. WashingtonPresident. 1797,\" the reverse showing many Masonic emblems,[89] with thelegend \"Amor. Honor. Et Justica G.W.G.G.M.\" (i. e., George Washington, General Grand Master).The writer of the letters to Washington, Snyder, quoted at the beginningof this chapter, being of foreign birth, and not a member of the MasonicFraternity, nor even living where a Masonic Lodge existed, evidentlylabored under the same delusion as the Brethren at Cape Francois.The Masonic Correspondence of Washington as represented upon thesepages, should settle for all time to come the question, as to the esteemin which Washington held the Masonic Fraternity, of which he was anhonored Member.It is stated that there are still a large number of Washington papers inthe Library of Congress, that are not accessible, as they have thus farnot been classified or indexed. Thus it is in the possibilities thatthere may be still further documentary evidence found of Masonic import,in addition to such as are set forth upon these pages.[Pg 140]Footnotes:[64] \"Memorial Volume, Washington Sesqui-centennial Anniversary,\" Philadelphia, 1902, p. 165.[65] \"PROOFS | of a| CONSPIRACY | against all the | RELIGIONS andGOVERNMENTS | of | EUROPE | carried on | in the secret meetings | of | FREEMASONS, ILLUMINATI, | and | READING SOCIETIES, | \" collected from GoodAuthorities | by | JOHN ROBISON, A.

That’s the question 32 front offices ask themselves every NFL offseason — and almost all of them land on the incorrect answer, for one reason or another. The two clubs that get it right, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-more-than-one-way-to-build-a-super-bowl-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">usually offer variations on a theme</a> for the rest of the league to copy. But we may never have seen two teams <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cincinnati-bengals-los-angeles-rams-super-bowl-11644129467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">take such radically different paths</a> to Super Bowl Sunday — or offer such different lessons in how to reach the cusp of a championship — as the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams this season.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">And that variety is a good thing for football. A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DKThomp/status/1391827053868105739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">common refrain from other sports</a> is that they’ve become too homogenized in their dominant strategies, whether it involves the rise of <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/glossary/idioms/three-true-outcomes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three true outcome</a>-based rosters in baseball or <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mapping-shots-in-the-nba-changed-it-forever/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3-point-shooting teams</a> in basketball. The NFL has its own <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33253649/commissioner-roger-goodell-says-nfl-fell-short-hiring-minority-head-coaches\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">massive homogeneity problems</a>, to be sure, but there’s less to complain about when it comes to teams all building the same way. Cincinnati and L.A. are the only two teams whose championship hopes have not yet been dashed, but how they got here is a study in contrasts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\\n<div class=\"non-jetpack-embed \"><iframe title=\"How the Bengals got to Super Bowl LVI\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-7VJSY\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7VJSY/5/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"400\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Cincinnati’s rise this season was meteoric.

But after rising to No. 12 in Elo with that victory, Cincy hit a snag — losing four of its next six contests to drop back down to No. 22 in Elo. That’s when the Bengals went on another tear, winning six of seven to close the regular season and begin the playoffs — the lone blemish being a start by backup quarterback Brandon Allen <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201090cle.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in Week 18</a>. After an <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-finally-have-a-super-bowl-matchup-and-its-exactly-what-we-expected/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">impressive upset comeback</a> against the Kansas City Chiefs, Cincinnati now ranks seventh in Elo, a 20-slot improvement on its Week 1 ranking.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The Bengals’ journey is a testament to the power of building with young talent through the draft. The team took <a href=\"http://pfref.com/pi/share/bptXt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">four of its five best offensive players</a> this season by <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/approximate-value-methodology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Approximate Value</a> (AV) — QB Joe Burrow (15 AV), receivers Ja’Marr Chase (13) and Tee Higgins (10) and lineman Jonah Williams (9) — with picks in the <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/draft.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top 33 slots of each of the past three drafts</a>. Expanding the scope of things slightly, nearly 75 percent of the Bengals’ total yards from scrimmage this season were gained by players Cincinnati selected over the past five drafts (a list that includes <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/2021.htm#rushing_and_receiving::7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leading rusher Joe Mixon</a> as well). That’s a perfect recipe for a great young core, if not necessarily an experienced one. In terms of average age and previous career AV — weighted by the amount of AV each player produced during the season itself — the Bengals have both the youngest and the least-established roster of any team in Super Bowl history:</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"core-html \">\\n<section class=\"viz\">\\n <header class=\"viz\">\\n <h5 class=\"title\">The Bengals are the youngest Super Bowl team ever</h5>\\n <p class=\"subtitle\">Super Bowl teams by lowest average age of roster, plus previous career Approximate Value (AV), 1966-2021</p>\\n </header>\\n <table class=\"viz full\" data-carpenter-slug=\"paine.sb-teams-22.0\">\\n <thead>\\n <tr>\\n <th colspan=\"2\" class=\"upper\" style=\"border-right: 10px solid #ffffff\"></th>\\n <th colspan=\"2\" class=\"upper upper-text\">AV-Weighted Average</th>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"no-parent text\">Season</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"no-parent text\">Team</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"number\" style=\"font-weight:400;width:28%\">Previous Career AV</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"number\" style=\"font-weight:400;width:25%\">Age</th>\\n </tr>\\n </thead>\\n <tbody>\\n <tr style=\"background-color: #ffa06b\">\\n <td class=\"text bold\">2021</td>\\n <td class=\"text bold\">Bengals</td>\\n <td class=\"number bold\" style=\"width:28%\">14.4</td>\\n <td class=\"number bold\" style=\"width:25%\">25.8</td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">1971</td>\\n <td class=\"text\">Dolphins</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:28%\">24.6</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:25%\">25.8</td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">2013</td>\\n <td class=\"text\">Seahawks</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:28%\">17.9</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:25%\">25.9</td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">1981</td>\\n <td class=\"text\">49ers</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:28%\">17.0</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:25%\">25.9</td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">1974</td>\\n <td class=\"text\">Steelers</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:28%\">22.2</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:25%\">25.9</td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">2014</td>\\n <td class=\"text\">Seahawks</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:28%\">24.4</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:25%\">26.0</td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">2019</td>\\n <td class=\"text\">49ers</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:28%\">17.3</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:25%\">26.1</td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">1996</td>\\n <td class=\"text\">Patriots</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:28%\">19.0</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:25%\">26.1</td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">1992</td>\\n <td class=\"text\">Cowboys</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:28%\">19.3</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:25%\">26.3</td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">2019</td>\\n <td class=\"text\">Chiefs</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:28%\">23.7</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:25%\">26.3</td>\\n </tr>\\n </tbody>\\n </table>\\n <footer class=\"viz\">\\n <p class=\"notes\">Averages are weighted by the amount of Approximate Value each player produced for the team during the Super Bowl season.</p>\\n <p class=\"source\">Source: Pro-Football-Reference.com</p>\\n </footer>\\n</section>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">That youth could serve the Bengals well for a while; a number of clubs on that list&nbsp; went on to contend beyond just their initial Super Bowl run. Win or lose, Cincinnati could be set up for lasting success based on the youth movement that has helped it reach this Super Bowl.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">And the success of the Bengals’ young stars this year ended up being key to their master rebuilding plan. Because so many of the team’s best offensive players make comparatively little money — Burrow, Chase, Higgins and Williams <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cincinnati-bengals/contracts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earn a combined average annual value</a> (AAV) of $23.3 million, or just under 13 percent <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-2021-salary-cap-182-5-million\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">of the salary cap</a>, while producing nearly 21 percent of the team’s AV — Cincinnati could maintain one of the league’s <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/#passing::21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most efficient passing offenses</a> despite committing the <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2021/offense/active-aav/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12th-fewest dollars of AAV to offense</a> of any team. In turn, that enabled Cincinnati to increase its spending on defense from the <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2020/defense/active-aav/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second-fewest AAV dollars</a> in 2020 to the <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2021/defense/active-aav/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10th-most in 2021</a>, and see its defensive performance improve from No. 25 in schedule-adjusted <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/8379024/nfl-explaining-expected-points-metric\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expected points added (EPA)</a> per game to No. 11. All of that, combined with the stellar play of its special teams corps (No. 3 in EPA), added up to make Cincinnati an unlikely — but far from illogical — AFC champion.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\'ornamental-rule\\'><hr /><span></span></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\\n<div class=\"non-jetpack-embed \"><iframe title=\"How the Rams got to Super Bowl LVI\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-tngR3\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tngR3/8/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"400\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">In many ways, the Rams took a completely opposite path to the Super Bowl. If little had been expected of Cincinnati coming into 2021, Los Angeles’s expectations were sky-high — pressure ratcheted up further by the <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/matthew-stafford-gave-the-rams-a-shot-at-a-title-the-rams-gave-stafford-a-shot-at-canton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offseason acquisition of QB Matthew Stafford</a> to help push a star-studded roster over the top. L.A. <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranked sixth in Elo</a> before the season, and it mostly played to that form all year long: After starting off like a team on a mission, winning seven of their first eight contests, the Rams suffered their only losing streak of the year at midseason but recovered by winning eight of nine across the end of the regular season and into the playoffs. Along the way, the Rams <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201230tam.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">knocked out</a> the defending-champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers — <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tom-brady-retires-with-all-the-records/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ending Tom Brady’s career</a> — and even <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201300ram.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vanquished their rival San Francisco 49ers</a>, who had beaten them twice during the regular season and <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-to-watch-for-in-the-nfls-conference-championships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seemed to pose the biggest matchup challenge</a> to L.A.’s preferred style of play.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">And in stark contrast with the Bengals’ plan to build around highly drafted young talent, the Rams have famously <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-love-trading-early-draft-picks-how-much-value-do-they-find-in-the-later-rounds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eschewed high draft picks</a> with a focus instead on building around established big names and hunting for late-round bargains. While Los Angeles’s <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-bengals-slow-down-aaron-donald-nothings-stopped-him-yet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most important player</a> — defensive lineman Aaron Donald — was selected by the Rams <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2014_draft.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with a first-round pick</a> in 2014, essentially <a href=\"http://pfref.com/pi/share/VxGT4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">none of L.A.’s other contributors</a> were taken by the team with a high pick. To the extent the Rams have any highly drafted players, they are stars like Stafford, cornerback Jalen Ramsey, linebackers Von Miller and Leonard Floyd and receiver Odell Beckham Jr. — all of whom were drafted by <em>other</em> teams and joined the Rams later.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">That has helped give Los Angeles one of the least-homegrown cast of characters to ever reach a Super Bowl, with 40.8 percent of the team’s total AV coming from players who did not make their NFL debuts as Rams. While not quite as extreme as a team like the <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/2002.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2002 Oakland Raiders</a> — for whom a stunning 56.3 percent of AV came from players drafted outside the organization — the Rams’ number still ranks them 13th out of the 112 teams in Super Bowl history, well above the all-time Super Bowl average of 25 percent for non-homegrown production.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a far cry from the days of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/pit/1979.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;1979 Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, who somehow received 100 percent of their production from homegrown players &mdash; which still makes them the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-nov-22-x4512&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;only entirely homegrown roster&lt;/a&gt; in Super Bowl history (a distinction they will likely always carry, as player movement is far greater in the NFL today than it was then).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-1\">1</sup></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The strategy has also brought plenty of roster churn since the last time the Rams were on the championship stage, even though it’s been only four seasons since Los Angeles <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-really-made-a-mess-of-super-bowl-liii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fell to the New England Patriots</a> in Super Bowl LIII. Compared with that team, L.A. in 2021 has a brand-new leading passer (Stafford instead of Jared Goff), leading rusher (Sony Michel, who was actually on the Patriots in 2018, instead of Todd Gurley), leading tackler (safety Jordan Fuller — who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JourdanRodrigue/status/1480692266909847554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suffered a season-ending injury</a> in Week 18 — instead of linebacker Cory Littleton) and only six total starters in common.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"2\" href=\"#fn-2\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defining &ldquo;starter&rdquo; as a player who started at least eight games.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-2\">2</sup></a> Overall, this year’s Rams roster received only 33.9 percent of its AV from players who had been on the 2018 Super Bowl team — so tear up your programs from February 2019 if you’re looking for a who’s who of L.A. stars.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Still, Los Angeles has impressively executed its grand, unconventional team-building strategy.

The U.S. women’s national team had, on the Olympic stage, finally overcome its rivals to the north for the first time in these players’ careers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The victory over Canada was a blockbuster moment for the U.S., but those gold medals with the five rings on them tell only a fraction of the story in what is one of the most bitter rivalries in women’s sports. And they leave out crucial stories of the growth of the game outside North America: the tale of Finland’s rise and Sweden’s swift fall, of a young Czech team that has the potential to stand toe to toe with giants. We’ve seen these stories again on display over the course of this Olympic tournament in Beijing, with the quarterfinals <a href=\"https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/ice-hockey/event-schedule-women.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">starting late Thursday</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The past three decades of women’s hockey is full of all the drama of a young sport on the rise, both on the ice and off. It features boycotts and contract negotiations, new opportunities and sudden collapses — and yes, gritty battles between the U.S. and Canadian teams.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">From the moment women’s hockey burst onto the international scene in 1990 — in front of 9,000 fans at the inaugural world championships held in Ottawa, Canada — there was an obvious and stark disparity in skill level between the North American teams and their counterparts from the rest of the world. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/sports/hockey/23hockey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Future Hockey Hall of Famers</a> such as Canada’s Angela James and the U.S.’s Cammi Granato led their teams in dominating many of their overmatched competitors. This gap would remain something of an abyss over the following nine years, with Canada emerging into the new decade with a +168 goal differential in just 26 international games played (across world championships and Olympics). The only other teams to end the 1990s with a positive number in the goal differential column were the United States (+140) and Finland (+106).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">We can also use a more advanced, all-in-one metric to show the highs and lows of the sport. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DigDeepBSB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike Murphy</a> created a women’s college hockey version of <a href=\"https://hockey-graphs.com/2020/06/25/examining-player-development-in-ncaa-di-womens-hockey-with-game-score-pt-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">game score</a>; our version, adapted for international play and limited by the data available, pares his version down somewhat, using goals, assists, shots on goal<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"4\" href=\"#fn-4\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shots on goal data isn’t available until 2000.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-4\">4</sup></a> and penalty infraction minutes. A country’s game score is the sum of individual player game scores.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Using Game Score to track the quality of the teams from 1990 on, what we see in that first decade is Canada and the U.S. locked in battle from the beginning, with Finland running a close third. Canada bested the U.S. in <a href=\"https://www.eurohockey.com/league/915-world-womens-championship.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all five world championships</a> held in the 1990s, but the U.S. did claim the <a href=\"https://teamusa.usahockey.com/page/show/2908052-1998-nagano-olympic-winter-games-women-s-tournament\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inaugural Olympic gold</a> in 1998 at Nagano.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full hide-mobile\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1078\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1@2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-325284\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1@2x.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1@2x.png?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1@2x.png\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1@2x.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1@2x.png?w=1400 2x\"></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full show-mobile\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"621\" height=\"2196\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1-mob@2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-325283\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1-mob@2x.png?w=621 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1-mob@2x.png?w=1242 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1-mob@2x.png\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1-mob@2x.png?w=621 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-1-mob@2x.png?w=1242 2x\"></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">While the 1990s signified a new and exciting era of women’s sports, the 2000s would see its staying power cemented, with North American leagues such as the National Women’s Hockey League (1999-2007) and Canadian Women’s Hockey League (2007-19) established. These leagues, while not professional leagues, provided female players with a competitive space to play post-college. Similarly, across the Atlantic, 2007 saw the establishment of the Swedish Women’s Hockey League, or Riksserien, as it was then known. With the world’s second-best league in the world in Scandinavia, and those nations’ elite talent able to compete against one another on a regular basis, nations like Finland and Sweden became increasingly competitive on the international stage. With Finland already putting pressure on them, and Sweden seemingly rapidly catching up, it was a make-or-break time for the USA and Canada with elite players on all four teams going head to head. The major difference was in large part due to the depth of North American rosters and their ability to draw on younger elite players than the Scandinavian nations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The development of young hockey players also gained a major push this decade when the NCAA national women’s hockey championships became an officially sanctioned event. (The first unofficial national collegiate championship <a href=\"https://www.powerplays.news/p/the-astonishing-story-behind-the\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">took place in 1998</a> and was financed by the United States Olympic Committee in the lead-up to Nagano.) The NCAA women’s hockey program would go on to become the proving ground for many elite female players over the course of the decade: Angela Ruggerio, Jennifer Botterill, Julie Chu and Jessie Vetter — some of the greatest female players to ever play on international ice — were among the winners of the Patty Kazmaier Award, bestowed on the top female player in college hockey each year. The national championship provided the vast majority of North American players with something that simply didn’t exist in Europe or Asia — with the full weight of Title IX aiding these players in their development.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">With more playing opportunities and greater development, the skill level in Canada and the U.S. kept rising — borne out by the intense matchups between the two countries. Canada continued its dominance for the first three world championships of the new millennium, though the U.S. bounced back to win three of the final four of the 2000s. In the Olympics, though, Canada rebounded from defeat at Nagano to take the 2002 and 2006 golds — and in Turin, the U.S. didn’t even make the gold-medal game, <a href=\"https://teamusa.usahockey.com/page/show/2908084-2006-torino-olympic-winter-games-women-s-tournament\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">falling to silver medalist Sweden</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full hide-mobile\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1085\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2@2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-325286\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2@2x.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2@2x.png?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2@2x.png\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2@2x.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2@2x.png?w=1400 2x\"></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full show-mobile\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"620\" height=\"2240\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2-mob@2x-USE.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-325290\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2-mob@2x-USE.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2-mob@2x-USE.png?w=1240 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2-mob@2x-USE.png\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2-mob@2x-USE.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-2-mob@2x-USE.png?w=1240 2x\"></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">The 2010s saw the start of professionalism in women’s hockey, with national teams seeing increased pay stipends, insurance and training infrastructure. It was during this time that the second iteration of the National Women’s Hockey League (now the Premier Hockey Federation) was founded and became <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/nwhl-first-paid-womens-pro-hockey-league-drops-puck-on-first-season/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the first league to officially pay female players</a> in any capacity before <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/sports/hockey/womens-hockey-league-will-pay-players-for-first-time.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Canadian</a> and Swedish leagues followed suit in subsequent years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">With increased visibility came increased opportunities for women in the post-collegiate sphere to continue playing longer, with additional support at both a national and team level. But this decade also saw some of the greatest unrest in women’s hockey, with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/19026627/usa-hockey-us-women-national-team-reach-agreement-avoid-boycott\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">boycotts by both the USA</a> and <a href=\"https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/08/16/swedish-womens-hockey-players-boycott-over-pay-dispute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swedish national teams</a> over player compensation, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/sports/cwhl-womens-hockey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shock folding of Canada’s CWHL</a> and the <a href=\"https://archive.thinkprogress.org/womens-hockey-players-association/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#forthegame movement</a> in North America.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The decade also brought about some of the sport’s most memorable highlights: the Canadian win on home ice during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics; the “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqBHav5puKA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ping Heard Round the World</a>” in the 2014 Olympic gold medal game, when the USA missed an empty-net goal, hitting the post instead, with just over a minute left. (Canada would go on to equalize 30 seconds later and then win in OT.) The USWNT won the 2017 world championships in overtime just days after reaching an agreement with U.S. Hockey, and then the team won gold for the first time in 20 years at the Pyeongchang Olympics on the anniversary of Miracle on Ice. And that’s not to forget Finland taking silver for the first time in history at the 2019 world championships (though <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/iihf-explains-why-the-goal-that-cost-finland-gold-was-disallowed-1.4380760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many may argue</a> that it <a href=\"https://www.theicegarden.com/2019/4/14/18310629/2019-womens-world-championship-iihf-controversy-finland-usa-gold-medal-game-goalie-interference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">should have been gold</a>).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full hide-mobile\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1060\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3@2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-325288\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3@2x.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3@2x.png?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3@2x.png\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3@2x.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3@2x.png?w=1400 2x\"></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full show-mobile\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"621\" height=\"2254\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3-mob@2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-325287\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3-mob@2x.png?w=621 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3-mob@2x.png?w=1242 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3-mob@2x.png\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3-mob@2x.png?w=621 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/longmuir.womens-hockey-3-mob@2x.png?w=1242 2x\"></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">Since COVID-19 first made its mark on sports in March 2020, there has been only one international women’s hockey tournament played at the top level: The 2021 world championships were eventually held in August 2021 after being canceled and postponed multiple times. Canada would take home the gold, making up for its first bronze medal in history during the 2019 event and placing the team in an excellent position heading into Beijing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The under-18 women’s worlds has now been <a href=\"https://nhl.nbcsports.com/2021/12/24/iihf-cancels-u18-womens-championship-for-2nd-straight-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">canceled two years in a row</a>, but the future of women’s hockey remains bright. Two years’ worth of rookies entering the U.S. and Canadian national systems together have introduced several exciting young stars, some of whom are sure to wear their national flag for at least the remainder of this decade.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Even at this early stage, we have already seen some players’ careers ignite. Sarah Fillier’s performance for Canada at the 2021 world championship shot her toward being a household name. At the same tournament, Grace Zumwinkle stepped out and shone, even among a star-studded U.S. lineup. And Dominika Lásková, who plays for Merrimack College in the NCAA, showed up big for the Czech Republic and was a key contributor to their offensive dominance, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/hockey/story/_/id/32085764/dominika-laskova-scores-twice-czech-republic-beats-germany-win-group-b-women-hockey-worlds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scoring four goals as a defender</a> — something her team will be hoping continues in Beijing. Finland, which is the biggest threat to the U.S. and Canada’s hold on the gold-medal game, saw goaltender Anni Keisala step up big at the worlds, all but cementing her position as the team’s starting goaltender and last line of defense. In the U.S. and Canada’s group play matchup in Beijing, Abby Roque emerged as a force for Team USA with an almost perfect faceoff record against the Canadians, and while she is still goal-less in the tournament, it feels like only a matter of time. Similarly, Fillier continues to defy even the loftiest of expectations, scoring on her opening shift in two straight games. And if the two teams, entering the semifinals seeded first and second, meet again in the Olympics, it will be in the gold-medal game.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The Olympics still stands taller than any other international tournament as the ultimate measure of not just a player’s skill but a country’s might — and for the first time in history, it might not be just a two-horse race this winter. While their lineups may be made of Titans of the Sport in players like Marie-Philip Poulin, Mélodie Daoust, Hilary Knight and Kendall Coyne Schofield, Canada and the United States are not invincible, and they can be beaten — Finland’s near-win in 2019 showed that. Other countries now boast stars comparable to those in North America: Finland has arguably the best defender in the world in Jenni Hiirikoski; Alina Müller, who <a href=\"http://reports.iihf.hockey/Hydra/436/IHW400000_85B_22_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">led the last Olympics in goals</a>, plays for Switzerland; Nana Fujimoto has the ability to completely lock down the goal crease for Japan, letting nothing past; and the Czech Republic might be the most fun team to watch.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">There may never have been a better time to get invested in women’s hockey. This tournament houses a rivalry that runs deep into the hearts of two nations, that makes a gold-medal game that finishes after 2 a.m. worth staying up for in the eyes of millions. It’s a chance to experience moments that will no doubt go down in hockey’s rich history.</p>]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Alyssa Longmuir]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Alyssa Longmuir\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alyssa-longmuir/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    Can The Bengals Slow Down Aaron Donald?

He’s not just the best at what he does, he’s the most impactful individual defender on the planet — and the Cincinnati Bengals’ offensive line might not be able to slow him down.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Donald’s credentials are impeccable. Aside from making the Pro Bowl in every one of his <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DonaAa00.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eight professional seasons</a> and being named first-team All-Pro seven years running, he’s won AP Defensive Player of the Year <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/awards/ap-defensive-player-of-the-year.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three of the last four seasons</a>. His tape backs up all the hardware, too; Pro Football Focus graded him as its best pass-rushing defensive lineman, fourth-best run-stopping defensive lineman and No. 1 overall defensive player of 2021.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"5\" href=\"#fn-5\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald was also Pro Football Focus&rsquo;s top-graded defender in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, among those with at least 20 percent of the league-maximum defensive snaps. In 2015, he finished second-highest, and his rookie year he tied for eighth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-5\">5</sup></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Donald doesn’t just pass the eye test, either. His 12.5 regular-season sacks tied for seventh-most in the NFL, and according to ESPN’s Stats &amp; Information Group, his 84 tackles from the defensive line ranked third. He ranked second among all front-seven defenders in pass rush win rate and tied for eighth in disrupted dropback rate.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"6\" href=\"#fn-6\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropback rate is the player&rsquo;s total of sacks, interceptions, batted passes and passes defensed, divided by opponent dropbacks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-6\">6</sup></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But ESPN’s Video Analysis Team saw Donald generate pressure on only 10.5 percent of his pass rushes\\u200b\\u200b, good for 22nd in the league.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"7\" href=\"#fn-7\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among players whose pass rushes are at least 10 times the number of their team&rsquo;s games.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-7\">7</sup></a> That’s just 0.1 percentage points more than new Ram Von Miller and 1 point less often than their teammate Leonard Floyd. If Donald is beating blockers more often than everyone but Dallas Cowboys edge rusher Micah Parsons, why is Parsons’s league-best pressure rate almost twice as high (18.3 percent)?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Teams put a lot more blockers in front of Donald.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“These guys triple-team [Donald],” <a href=\"https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2021/11/04/rams-von-miller-aaron-donald-cried-tears-joy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miller told reporters</a> in his introductory press conference. “I’ve been getting triple-teamed for the last 10 years. That’s six people right there. And we still got Leonard Floyd and all the other guys. So, it’s going to be fun.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Opponents aren’t <em>quite</em> committing six blockers to just Donald and Miller. But as an interior lineman, Donald gets double-teamed more often than ends — and far more than stand-up rushers like Parsons and Floyd. Only five defenders faced double-teams more often on pass-rush snaps than Donald, according to ESPN’s Stats &amp; Information Group. Yet nobody beat double-teams more often:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\\n<div class=\"non-jetpack-embed \"><iframe title=\"Double-teams couldn&#039;t stop Aaron Donald\" aria-label=\"Scatter Plot\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-GpAEk\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GpAEk/9/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"575\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Double-teaming Donald is necessary to slow him down, but it isn’t exactly sufficient. He beat solo blockers a league-high 34.2 percent of the time, and his win rate against double-teams was still a league-best 23.1 percent — the same as Haason Reddick’s eighth-ranked <em>overall</em> rate. As Miller implied, the interior threat presented by Donald limits how often opponents can put more than one body between any other Ram and their quarterback.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">For the Cowboys, Parsons was double-teamed on 21.4 percent of his pass rushes. But Miller faced two opponents on only 7.5 percent of his rushes for the Rams, and Floyd was double-teamed just 11.6 percent of the time. Because Donald was doubled on a whopping 64 percent of his pass-rush snaps, his wingmen on the edge each got to rush one-on-one about nine pass rushes out of 10 — and Donald got through the line more often than anyone but Parsons anyway. No wonder Los Angeles led the league in ESPN’s pass-rush win rate.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s a brutal matchup for the Bengals, who have one of the worst offensive lines in football. Their team pass-block win rate was third-lowest in the league this regular season. Pro Football Focus graded Cincinnati as the 25th-ranked pass-blocking team, with grades in the 50s (and below) for every regular contributor save left tackle Jonah Williams.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Center Trey Hopkins has been a recent bright spot, posting pass-protection grades above 70 in four of the past five games — including a 75.3 in the AFC championship game. He’s been asked more regularly to help out platooning right guards Jackson Carman and Hakeem Adeniji, whose pass-blocking grades have been a miserable 45.9 and 38.9, respectively. During this five-game run of good form for Hopkins, he’s blocked in tandem on 85.7 percent of Cincinnati’s dropbacks. That’s not only much higher than his regular-season rate of 81.4 percent, it’s higher than <em>any</em> NFL lineman’s regular-season double-team rate.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But it hasn’t done much good. Though Hopkins’s pass-block win rate over the last five games has improved to 95.8 percent, the Bengals’ team rate was still just 53.1 percent — which, had that been their regular-season number, would have only bumped them up from 30th to 29th. Cincinnati just doesn’t have anybody, or any combination of anybodies, who can keep Donald and company away from quarterback Joe Burrow for very long.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">If Los Angeles wins, three of its hired-gun Pro Bowlers — Matthew Stafford, Odell Beckham Jr. and Eric Weddle — would get their first Super Bowl rings.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"8\" href=\"#fn-8\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller already has one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-8\">8</sup></a> But Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris said the team is focused on delivering a title to the player who’s been here all this time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“This building wants to win for Aaron Donald to create more mystique to his legacy and what he’s done,” <a href=\"https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2022/01/27/raheem-morris-we-want-to-win-for-aaron-donalds-legacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Morris told the Associated Press</a>. “We want to win for Aaron Donald.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But Donald might win it for them first.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><em>Check out our latest </em><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/?ex_cid=endlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>NFL predictions</em></a><em>.</em></p>\\n]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Ty Schalter]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Ty Schalter\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/ty-schalter/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    Matthew Stafford Gave The Rams A Shot At A Title.

The former No. 1 pick desperately <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30880411/matthew-stafford-says-trade-request-detroit-lions-was-hardest-conversation-ever-had-surprised-landed-los-angeles-rams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">needed a change in scenery</a> after 12 years in Detroit, and the Rams desperately <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30732512/los-angeles-rams-coach-sean-mcvay-vague-jared-goff-future-qb-everything-being-evaluated\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wanted an upgrade over Jared Goff</a> at QB.

With so much riding on it this year, the Stafford Experiment in L.A. could not afford to fail.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Fortunately for the Rams, it didn’t — and now Stafford and company are a <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rams-or-bengals-our-guide-to-super-bowl-lvi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">win over the Cincinnati Bengals away</a> from making it into the ultimate success story. Along the way, Stafford may also have reshaped his entire legacy and even helped us learn something about the effect coaching systems can have on a new quarterback (and vice versa).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s not as though Stafford’s Lions career had been a disappointment. Indeed, his pre-2021 career <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/approximate-value-methodology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Approximate Value (AV)</a> of 133 had already far exceeded the number <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150329222816/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we would expect from a No. 1 overall pick</a> (73). Back in 2011, the so-called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUlZkfH758U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Year of the Quarterback</a>, Stafford <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2011/leaders.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was front and center</a>, alongside future Hall of Famers Tom Brady and Drew Brees, as one of three passers with at least 5,000 yards, the first time any season <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=1&amp;order_by=year_id&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=5000&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=pass_yds&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had ever seen such prolific passing</a>.

Over his career, Stafford was <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=qb_w&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;team_id=det&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">easily the winningest quarterback</a> in the history of the Lions, one of the NFL’s <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/#teams_active::1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oldest teams</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/#all_teams_av_images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second-best player in franchise history</a> according to AV — trailing only the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VGmQ4SvTY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">incomparable Barry Sanders</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But although Stafford made the playoffs three times with Detroit — its <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">only three postseason berths</a> this century — the team bowed out in the wild-card round each time. And despite playing with fellow stars such as <a href=\"https://theatlantavoice.com/hometown-hero-calvin-johnson-gets-enshrined-at-pro-football-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hall of Fame wide receiver</a> Calvin Johnson and dominating defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh for many of his Lions seasons, Stafford left Detroit with a losing record (74-90-1) and facing questions about whether his individual stats could foster team success. While the Lions’ defense was largely ineffective during Stafford’s seasons as a primary starter, allowing an average of 2.4 more points per game than the typical NFL team, the team’s offense was also surprisingly mediocre — scoring 0.3 fewer points per game than average over the same span.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">That all changed with the Rams this season. Between the regular season and playoffs, Los Angeles is averaging 27.2 points per game, which ranks sixth in the league and is 4.2 points better than the NFL average. That was the best offensive output (relative to average) for a Stafford-led team since the Lions were +7.3 points per game in 2011, and just the second time after 2013 that a Stafford-led team scored more than the league average. Unsurprisingly, Stafford had one of his finest individual passing seasons as well. This was the <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StafMa00.htm#passing_advanced::12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second-best performance</a> of his 13-year career by adjusted net yards per attempt index, <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StafMa00.htm#passing::31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second-best (in a tie)</a> by AV, third-best by <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-the-ways-that-tom-brady-is-footballs-goat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QB value over replacement</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StafMa00.htm#passing::23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fourth-best</a> by Total Quarterback Rating and <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/player/22338/matthew-stafford\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fourth-best</a> by Football Outsiders’ <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/methods#DVOA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Defense-adjusted Value Over Average</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Perhaps most importantly, Stafford has provided important new elements to coach Sean McVay’s offense that Goff couldn’t last season. In 2020, Goff ranked just 33rd out of 35 qualified QBs in air yards per attempt, 26th in touchdowns per attempt, 26th in first downs per attempt, 22nd in yards per completion and 28th in the share of attempts going for positive air yards. This regular season, by contrast, Stafford ranked fifth in air yards per throw, second in TDs per throw, fifth in first downs per throw, third in yards per completion and fourth in the share of attempts with positive air yards. While Stafford wasn’t perfect in his Rams debut — he <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing.htm#passing::14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tied for the league lead in interceptions</a>, with a per-attempt pick rate (2.8 percent) slightly higher than Goff’s last year (2.4 percent) — he offset those risks with far greater rewards throwing downfield.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Stafford also performed much better under pressure — both literal and metaphorical — which in turn affected how defenses responded to L.A.’s attack. In 2020, Goff had the NFL’s sixth-worst QBR under pressure and sixth-worst QBR against man-to-man defenses, which encouraged opponents to load up on extra pass-rushers without fear of repercussions. Last season, only five QBs faced more blitzes per dropback than Goff’s 32.2 percent rate. But since Stafford handled the heat better (he ranked 14th-best in QBR under pressure) and posed more of a threat to burn any defenders left exposed in coverage — he led the NFL in QBR against man-to-man this year — opponents backed off and blitzed him at the fifth-lowest rate (21.8 percent) of any qualified QB, which helped give McVay’s play designs more time and space in which to operate. Only four other QBs this season threw to receivers who were less tightly covered, as defined by the <a href=\"https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NFL’s Next Gen Stats</a>, than Stafford did.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Stafford earned even more respect from the defense in big moments, as the Rams went from having the NFL’s 10th-worst fourth-quarter passer by QBR with Goff in 2020 to its No. 1 fourth-quarter passer with Stafford at the helm in 2021. All of these factors helped to elevate the Rams’ offense from 21st in schedule-adjusted <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/8379024/nfl-explaining-expected-points-metric\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expected points added</a> (EPA) per game — and 23rd in passing EPA, specifically — last season to sixth on offense (and fifth in passing) this year. When given the opportunity to better harness his skills and lead a winning attack, Stafford did not squander it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Such second acts are rare for Super Bowl quarterbacks, historically speaking. The average QB making his first Super Bowl start has been 28.4 years old during the season in question,<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"9\" href=\"#fn-9\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age given as of Dec. 31 of that season.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-9\">9</sup></a> much younger than Stafford (who was 33 for most of this season and turned 34 on Monday). The average debut Super Bowl starter was also usually playing for his first NFL team (71 percent of first-time starters), or at least the team with whom he generated the majority of his career QB value over replacement (84 percent). But Stafford bucks all of those trends. He is one of just five quarterbacks to make their first Super Bowl start at age 30 or older, with a team for whom they generated less than half of their career value:</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"core-html \">\\n<section class=\"viz\">\\n <header class=\"viz\">\\n <h5 class=\"title\">Stafford is in an exclusive club of journeymen</h5>\\n <p class=\"subtitle\">First-time Super Bowl starting QBs who were at least 30 years old during the season and had earned less than half of their career value with their Super Bowl team</p>\\n </header>\\n <table class=\"viz full\" data-carpenter-slug=\"paine.stafford.1\">\\n <thead>\\n <tr>\\n <th colspan=\"4\" class=\"upper\" style=\"border-right: 10px solid #ffffff\"></th>\\n <th colspan=\"2\" class=\"upper upper-text\" style=\"border-right: 10px solid #ffffff\">QB Value Over Replacement</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"upper\"></th>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"no-parent text\">Quarterback</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"no-parent text\" style=\"text-align:center\">Season</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"no-parent text\" style=\"text-align:center\">Team</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"no-parent text\" style=\"text-align:center\">Age*</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"number\" style=\"font-weight:400;width:13%\">w/ Team</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"number\" style=\"font-weight:400;width:15%\">Share of Total</th>\\n <th colspan=\"1\" class=\"no-parent number\" style=\"text-align:center;width:10%\">Won SB?</th>\\n </tr>\\n </thead>\\n <tbody>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">Brad Johnson</td>\\n <td class=\"text\" style=\"text-align:center\">2002</td>\\n <td class=\"text\" style=\"text-align:center\">TB</td>\\n <td class=\"text highlight\" style=\"text-align:center\">34</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:13%\">2,851</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:15%\" data-suffix=\"%\" data-suffixpadding=\"1.1em\">37.0%</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"text-align:center;width:10%\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f48d.png\" alt=\"💍\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">Jim Plunkett</td>\\n <td class=\"text\" style=\"text-align:center\">1980</td>\\n <td class=\"text\" style=\"text-align:center\">OAK</td>\\n <td class=\"text highlight\" style=\"text-align:center\">33</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:13%\">2,848</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width: 15%;padding-right: 1.1em\">41.7</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"text-align:center;width:10%\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f48d.png\" alt=\"💍\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">Chris Chandler</td>\\n <td class=\"text\" style=\"text-align:center\">1998</td>\\n <td class=\"text\" style=\"text-align:center\">ATL</td>\\n <td class=\"text highlight\" style=\"text-align:center\">33</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:13%\">2,702</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width: 15%;padding-right: 1.1em\">46.0</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"text-align:center;width:10%\"></td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text bold\">Matthew Stafford</td>\\n <td class=\"text bold\" style=\"text-align:center\">2021</td>\\n <td class=\"text bold\" style=\"text-align:center\">LAR</td>\\n <td class=\"text highlight bold\" style=\"text-align:center\">33</td>\\n <td class=\"number bold\" style=\"width:13%\">1,320</td>\\n <td class=\"number bold\" style=\"width: 15%;padding-right: 1.1em\">12.6</td>\\n <td class=\"number bold\" style=\"text-align:center;width:10%\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2753.png\" alt=\"❓\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></td>\\n </tr>\\n <tr>\\n <td class=\"text\">Doug Williams</td>\\n <td class=\"text\" style=\"text-align:center\">1987</td>\\n <td class=\"text\" style=\"text-align:center\">WSH</td>\\n <td class=\"text highlight\" style=\"text-align:center\">32</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width:13%\">1,269</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"width: 15%;padding-right: 1.1em\">26.7</td>\\n <td class=\"number\" style=\"text-align:center;width:10%\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f48d.png\" alt=\"💍\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></td>\\n </tr>\\n </tbody>\\n </table>\\n <footer class=\"viz\">\\n <p class=\"notes\">*Player’s age on Dec. 31 of that season.</p>\\n <p class=\"source\">Source: pro-football-reference.com</p>\\n </footer>\\n</section>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Most of the other names on that list had surprising success in the big game itself, which Stafford can hope to emulate Sunday. Of the winners, Doug Williams was on his second NFL team — and third pro team, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Williams_(quarterback)#Oklahoma_/_Arizona_Outlaws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">if we count the USFL</a> — when he won as a Super Bowl rookie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXII\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 1988</a>, while Brad Johnson and Jim Plunkett were on NFL team Nos. 3 apiece at the time of their victories. Plunkett and Williams <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were each named MVP</a> for their efforts as well, providing a rich template for the type of journeyman success Stafford is aiming for against the Bengals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">And if he and the Rams do pull off the win, it would do wonders for Stafford’s legacy. According to Pro-Football-Reference.com’s <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2019/12/introducing-the-pfr-hof-monitor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hall of Fame monitor statistic</a>, which uses AV and many other measures to judge a player’s suitability for enshrinement in Canton, Stafford <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/hof/hofm_QB.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">currently ranks 41st among all-time quarterbacks</a> with a monitor score (58.4) — well below the average for QBs already in the Hall (109), in addition to trailing contemporaries such as Aaron Rodgers (174.8), Matt Ryan (102.6), Russell Wilson (80.3) and Cam Newton (70.5). A Super Bowl appearance <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/pfr-hof-monitor-methodology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">will automatically boost</a> Stafford’s score some, but he could gain as many as 10 extra points for winning the game (and also thereby eradicating his penalty for never winning a championship). That still wouldn’t put Stafford in clear Hall of Fame territory, but it would elevate him from a tier alongside Drew Bledsoe, Donovan McNabb and Carson Palmer into the company of Joe Theismann, Boomer Esiason and HOFer Len Dawson — and ahead of Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and Troy Aikman.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Cincinnati will have a word or two to say about how history views Stafford before Sunday’s contest is all said and done. Time and again this postseason, the young Bengals <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rams-or-bengals-our-guide-to-super-bowl-lvi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have diagnosed</a> how opposing passers are finding success and adapted to stop it with suffocating second halves. Even Stafford’s fourth-quarter dominance might not be immune to Cincy’s defensive scheming. But if he is able to crack that code, Stafford will have delivered to the Rams exactly what they were envisioning when they traded for him: a championship-caliber quarterback performance in a season when failure — for both player and team — was not an option.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><em>Check out our latest </em><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/?ex_cid=endlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>NFL predictions</em></a><em>.</em></p>\\n]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Neil Paine]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Neil Paine\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/neil-paine/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n     neil.paine@fivethirtyeight.com\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    Without NHL Players, Canada And The U.S. Went From Men’s Hockey Favorites To Also-Rans\\n   </title>\\n   <link/>\\n   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/without-nhl-players-canada-and-the-u-s-went-from-mens-hockey-favorites-to-also-rans/\\n   <dc:creator>\\n    <![CDATA[Neil Paine]]>\\n   </dc:creator>\\n   <pubdate>\\n    Tue, 08 Feb 2022 15:00:00 +0000\\n   </pubdate>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[2022 Beijing Olympics]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[2022 Winter Olympics]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Beijing Olympics]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Canadian Hockey]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Hockey]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[NHL]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Team USA]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Winter Olympics]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <guid ispermalink=\"false\">\\n    https://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&amp;p=325088\\n   </guid>\\n   <description>\\n    <![CDATA[When the Olympic men’s ice hockey tournament gets underway Wednesday, it will look very different from what we were expecting just a handful of months ago.

Because the ROC can freely stock its roster with players from Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League, which is <a href=\"https://thehockeywriters.com/top-10-best-ice-hockey-leagues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">widely regarded</a> as the world’s best non-NHL league, its drop-off in talent without NHL players was not nearly so steep as it was for Canada and the U.S. In fact, the “OAR” (Olympic Athletes from Russia) roster <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_2018_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_team_rosters#Russia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">from 2018</a> was made up entirely of KHL players, and it outscored opponents 27-9 en route to gold in South Korea.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/krejci-staal-power-among-olympic-hockey-players-to-watch/2022/02/07/69f18e18-87e7-11ec-838f-0cfdf69cce3c_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">isn’t as though</a> the Canadian and American rosters will be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_team_rosters#Canada\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">totally devoid of recognizable talent</a> in Beijing. Canada’s captain, Eric Staal, has scored <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/s/staaler01.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 1,000 career NHL points</a> and <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-that-could-go-wrong-for-the-buffalo-sabres-has-gone-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">may make the Hall of Fame</a> someday — though at age 37 he is very much past his prime. Many of the top players taken in <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/NHL_2021_entry.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent</a> <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/NHL_2020_entry.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NHL drafts</a> will also be present, including both of the top two picks in 2021 (Canada’s Owen Power and Matthew Beniers of the U.S.). Other former NHL names in the tournament include David Krejčí of the Czech Republic, who <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/k/krejcda01.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scored 730 points</a> in a 15-year career with the Boston Bruins.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">If there is a silver lining, the NHL’s decision to back out of the Beijing Olympics will <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/beijing-winter-olympics/after-nhl-backs-out-beijing-olympics-will-showcase-hockeys-next-generation/2783261/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open up opportunities</a> for an exciting young generation of players to show off on a global stage. But that won’t fully make up for most of the world’s best players not being present. While Canada and the U.S. could always surprise, they went from favorites to also-rans without their NHL talent bases — and in their place, the Russian Olympic Committee picked up the torch of the favorite once again.</p>]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Neil Paine]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Neil Paine\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/neil-paine/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n     neil.paine@fivethirtyeight.com\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    We Can Help With Your Bitcoin-Themed Super Bowl Prop Bet\\n   </title>\\n   <link/>\\n   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-can-help-with-your-bitcoin-themed-super-bowl-prop-bet/\\n   <dc:creator>\\n    <![CDATA[Josh Hermsmeyer]]>\\n   </dc:creator>\\n   <pubdate>\\n    Tue, 08 Feb 2022 15:00:00 +0000\\n   </pubdate>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Bitcoin]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[NFL]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Prop Bets]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Super Bowl]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Super Bowl LVI]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <guid ispermalink=\"false\">\\n    https://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&amp;p=325095\\n   </guid>\\n   <description>\\n    <![CDATA[It’s Super Bowl week, and that means it’s time for a yearly tradition that is near and dear to our hearts: analyzing silly proposition bets that have nothing to do with the game’s outcome.&#160; Each year during the Super Bowl, sportsbooks around the world offer prop bets on everything from the result of the opening [&#8230;]]]>\\n   </description>\\n   <content:encoded>\\n    <![CDATA[<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1150\" height=\"752\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SUPER-BOWL-BITCOIN-TOPPER.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-325111\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SUPER-BOWL-BITCOIN-TOPPER.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SUPER-BOWL-BITCOIN-TOPPER.png?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SUPER-BOWL-BITCOIN-TOPPER.png\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SUPER-BOWL-BITCOIN-TOPPER.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SUPER-BOWL-BITCOIN-TOPPER.png?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption><p class=\"photo-credit credits\">EMILY SCHERER</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s Super Bowl week, and that means it’s time for a yearly tradition that is near and dear to our hearts: analyzing silly proposition bets that have nothing to do with the game’s outcome.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Each year during the Super Bowl, sportsbooks around the world offer prop bets on everything from the result of the opening coin toss to the person the Super Bowl MVP will mention first in his speech. Typically, books are quite careful about the odds they post and the bets they accept. After all, if they weren’t cautious, they wouldn’t be in business for long. But the Super Bowl makes everyone a little bit crazy, and books can sometimes offer good odds on exotic bets that are hard to properly price. And the wagers make for interesting puzzles. In previous years, we’ve analyzed props on how long Gladys Knight would take to <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-super-bowls-best-matchup-is-gladys-knight-vs-the-clock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sing the national anthem</a>, the most likely opening song in <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-tried-to-predict-j-los-first-song-at-the-super-bowl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jennifer Lopez’s halftime show</a>, and which word <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/poetry-at-the-super-bowl-you-can-bet-on-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amanda Gorman would utter first</a> during the performance of her pregame poem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">This year we’re conducting our most ridiculous analysis yet: We attempt to handicap whether the price of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bitcoin</a> will rise or fall during the Super Bowl. As of this writing,<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"14\" href=\"#fn-14\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 p.m. Eastern on Feb. 7.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-14\">14</sup></a> the odds that bitcoin — the cryptocurrency that some love, and others love to hate — will rise are slightly higher than the odds that it will fall, at least according to the online sportsbook Bovada. The money line for the wager that the price of bitcoin will rise is currently priced at -130, which represents an implied probability of 56.5 percent (inclusive of the sportsbooks’ margin, or vigorish). Meanwhile, the line for a bitcoin Super Bowl retreat is even, good for an implied probability of 50 percent. Bovada apparently believes the bulls will be out on Super Bowl Sunday, pumping up the price of bitcoin. But is it on the right side of this particular wager?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Before we answer that question, we should first delve into the drivers of bitcoin price fluctuations — and there are <a href=\"https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-volatility-vs-other-assets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a lot of fluctuations</a>. Unlike other tradable assets like commodities or equities, bitcoin’s price doesn’t typically move on changes in the cryptocurrency’s underlying fundamentals. The code that controls bitcoin continues to change as <a href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.21.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new features are added</a>, but the basic underpinnings of the cryptocurrency that affect the scarcity — and thus, at least ostensibly, the price of a bitcoin — have been fairly stable over the past decade.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"15\" href=\"#fn-15\" data-footnote-content=\\'&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, bitcoin has had no “hard forks” — changes to the code that obsolete previous versions of the software — &lt;a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2012-02-18-protocol-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;since 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\'><sup id=\"ss-15\">15</sup></a> Instead, the price of bitcoin is driven by speculation. Investors bet on what other investors will do in the future, and if enough people believe that <em>other people believe</em> that bitcoin will go up in price, and act on it, bitcoin will indeed go up in price. Some refer to this type of behavior as a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculativebubble.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">speculative bubble</a>, and we’ll be engaging in exactly this type of analysis to understand which side of this wager to bet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">First, to ground our expectations, we need a base rate. We used BTC closing price data posted <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on Kaggle</a> by <a href=\"https://mcz.fyi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mark Zielinski</a> from 2012 through March 2021, collected at one-minute intervals from various exchanges.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"16\" href=\"#fn-16\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing price is the price of bitcoin at the end of each one-minute interval.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-16\">16</sup></a> We filtered the price data to just those trades that occurred from the kickoff to the final snap of each Super Bowl since 2013.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"17\" href=\"#fn-17\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not enough BTC trade data to conduct a price analysis for earlier Super Bowls.

It wasn’t until 2017 — when <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/tom-brady-gisele-b-ndchen-take-equity-stake-in-crypto-firm-ftx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">now-noted cryptocurrency enthusiast Tom Brady</a> led the New England Patriots to a historic comeback <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7NRx9J7Too\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">after falling behind 28-3</a> to the Atlanta Falcons — that bitcoin ended its first Super Bowl with a price higher than when the game started. The tenacious currency followed its first win with another in Super Bowl LII. Two years of losses followed in Super Bowl LIII and Super Bowl LIV before bitcoin rebounded last year in Brady’s final Super Bowl win, with Tampa Bay.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s perhaps fitting that the only Super Bowls over the past nine years in which bitcoin’s price rose were ones that involved Brady. Or maybe it’s just because Brady <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tom-brady-retires-with-all-the-records/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">played in so damn many</a> Super Bowls. But while Brady won seven of the 10 times he stepped on the field for a championship game, bitcoin has fared much worse: In six of the past nine Super Bowls, the cryptocurrency has lost value over the course of the game.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">With this base rate of 66.6 percent in hand, we can look for reasons to adjust our expectation for bitcoin’s price at the end of Super Bowl LVI. Most promising for bitcoin bulls: The last time bitcoin was coming off an all-time high at the end of a calendar year, and subsequently followed that peak with an implosion of at least 40 percent of its total value, bitcoin’s price rose in the Super Bowl. In late 2017, bitcoin reached a then-record high of nearly $20,000, only to promptly set itself on fire in early 2018 and drop to a pregame Super Bowl LII price of $7,876. Bitcoin’s Super Bowl <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadcatbounce.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dead cat bounce</a> was large, as bitcoin rose all the way to $8,238 by the end of the game.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Bitcoin faces a similar situation this year. After peaking at <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$67,549 in early November</a>, it dipped below $40,000 last month and is currently trading around $42,000 heading into Super Bowl LVI. Speculators could leverage the game to try to pump up the price, especially if Crypto.com airs its commercial starring Matt Damon reminding viewers that “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fortune favors the brave</a>.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">We concede that the chance of a price drop is probably lower than 66.6 percent, but there are other reasons to short bitcoin in-game. The Super Bowl attracts millions of viewers each year, but the share of 18- to 49-year-olds that watch the game has been <a href=\"https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/super-bowl-ratings-historical-viewership-chart-cbs-nbc-fox-abc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">steadily decreasing</a> during the bitcoin era. In 2013, 50.2 million people in the “key demographic” watched the Super Bowl. In 2021, that number was just 34.3 million. If most bitcoin speculators are <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/google-analytics-bitcoin-demographics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">men between the ages of 18 and 45</a>, the Super Bowl seems to have become a less reliable way to reach them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">And finally, a pump isn’t worth much to a pumper without a subsequent dump. If speculators see bitcoin’s price spike during the game, they may sell en masse to lock in their profits. Most of the recent bitcoin price charts show this pattern of sell-offs after a second-half price spike, and that seems more likely than not to repeat. All of which makes a wager on bitcoin’s price falling during the Super Bowl at even money a solid value bet.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Best of all, you don’t have to buy fake money to potentially profit from betting against bitcoin. Bovada and other sportsbooks still accept dollars, and they still settle their bets with actual United States legal tender. <a href=\"https://nftska.com/gm-it-means-more-than-you-think-nft-terminology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Good morning</a>, crypto fam.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><em>Check out our latest </em><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/?ex_cid=endlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>NFL predictions</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Josh Hermsmeyer]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Josh Hermsmeyer\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/josh-hermsmeyer/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    NFL Kickers Are On Fire This Postseason\\n   </title>\\n   <link/>\\n   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-kickers-are-coming-through-in-the-clutch-this-postseason/\\n   <dc:creator>\\n    <![CDATA[Alex Kirshner]]>\\n   </dc:creator>\\n   <pubdate>\\n    Tue, 08 Feb 2022 11:00:00 +0000\\n   </pubdate>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Cincinnati Bengals]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Evan McPherson]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Kickers]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[NFL]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[NFL Kickers]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[NFL Playoffs]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Super Bowl]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Super Bowl LVI]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <guid ispermalink=\"false\">\\n    https://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&amp;p=325030\\n   </guid>\\n   <description>\\n    <![CDATA[That NFL kickers are much better than they used to be is not a new development.

The leaguewide percentage of made field goals rose steadily in the 2000s and again in the mid-2010s, to the point where kickers can now be expected to make around 84 or 85 percent of their field goals every season. (In 2019, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-thought-nfl-kickers-would-keep-getting-better-but-this-year-theyre-struggling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an exceptionally weird year</a>, they made 81.6 percent.) Kickers aren’t just making more of their field goals, but they’re doing it from farther out. In the early 2000s, the average attempt was from about 36 yards out. Now, it’s from 39. The NFL has tried to rein in kickers a bit, but only with mild success — and only on extra points.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"18\" href=\"#fn-18\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-moves-extra-point-to-15-yard-line-for-2015-season-0ap3000000493347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2015 rule change&lt;/a&gt; that backed extra-point kick attempts from the 2-yard line to the 15 dropped their make rate from around 99 percent to about 93 most years. It&rsquo;s a step removed from automatic, but not a big one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-18\">18</sup></a> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">What <em>is </em>new is that kickers in the 2021 playoffs are pushing the position to new heights. Kickers have had postseasons with higher percentages of made field goals, but as a combination of volume, pressure and difficulty, they’ve never had as much on their plate as they’ve had this winter. They have delivered to an unprecedented extent — even to the point of the once-thought-impossible feat of taking the Cincinnati Bengals back to a Super Bowl.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">So far in the playoffs, NFL kickers are 41-of-46 on field goals. Their 89.1 percent make rate is the fifth-highest in a postseason this century, most notably behind 2016’s 97.6 (40-of-41) mark.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"19\" href=\"#fn-19\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lone miss in the 2016 playoffs came off the foot of the Green Bay Packers&rsquo; Mason Crosby: a 41-yarder in the NFC championship against the Atlanta Falcons.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-19\">19</sup></a> Kickers are 7-for-9 on field goals from at least 50 yards, and the average attempt has come from 39.9 yards out — compared with 38 yards in 2016’s nearly perfect postseason for kickers. The 2021 playoffs’ average kick distance narrowly trails 2017’s 40.1 yards for the longest of the century. The seven made kicks from 50-plus yards put them two made kicks behind the record nine (on 11 attempts) that kickers set in <em>last </em>year’s playoffs. (The leaguewide make percentage from at least 50 yards in regular-season games since 2000 is 59.5.) </p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"core-html \">\\n\\n<section class=\"viz\">\\n <header class=\"viz\">\\n

the 2021 season.</p>\\n <p class=\"source\">Source: ESPN Stats &amp; Information Group</p>\\n </footer>\\n</section>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">That looks like the continuation of a trend, rather than a true leveling-up of kicking as an art form. But kickers’ performances in high-leverage moments this postseason have set them apart even from their mega-accurate peers of recent memory. Bengals rookie kicker Evan McPherson is responsible for three of this postseason’s seven successful field goals from 50-plus yards. He hit from 54 and 52 in a divisional-round win at the Tennessee Titans, the latter coming as time expired to send Cincinnati to the AFC championship. Then he hit another 52-yarder in the fourth quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs before kicking the game-winner in overtime from a comparatively paltry 31 yards.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">McPherson is both a microcosm of — and a driving force behind — NFL kickers’ special showing in these playoffs. Kickers have posted slightly better make percentages in past postseasons, but there’s never been a playoffs in which they’ve so robotically drilled field goals in the biggest moments of the year. Before this year, kickers hadn’t <em>attempted</em> more than 15 fourth-quarter or overtime field goals in a postseason since at least 2000. This year, they’re 18-of-19 in those time periods, including 4-of-4 from 50-plus yards. And on PATs, kickers have missed three out of 60 in the playoffs, but they’re 13-for-13 after the third quarter. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">In the last two minutes of the fourth quarter alone, kickers are 6-for-6 on field goals. Two of those were 30-yard chip shots by the Los Angeles Rams’ Matt Gay, but the other four were all from 44 to 52 yards in massive pressure cookers. The Chiefs’ Harrison Butker forced overtime with buzzer-beaters in both the divisional and championship rounds, the San Francisco 49ers’ Robbie Gould flushed a 45-yarder in the Lambeau Field snow in the divisional round, and McPherson got rid of the AFC’s top seed with a 52-yarder in the divisional round. And even Gay’s shorter field goals carried plenty of pressure; L.A. won both of those games by 3 points, and his winning kick against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers not only delivered a walkoff for his team but also ended the career of the <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-tom-brady-the-goatiest-of-all-the-goats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">greatest quarterback in the history of the sport</a>.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">There’s been no recent postseason in which NFL teams have asked so much of kickers in such fraught situations. They’ve responded almost perfectly, and <em>literally </em>perfectly at the end of games. (In addition to 6-for-6 in the last two minutes of regulation, McPherson converted on the only overtime field goal attempt of the playoffs to date.)&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">What’s led to this wild success in crucial spots? It’s best not to draw immediate conclusions from these playoffs alone, other than that McPherson, a 2021 fifth-round pick out of Florida who was not alive when the Bengals last won a playoff game before this year, is an iceman. But NFL kickers have been improving for decades, and at least one contributing factor is not hard to identify: specialization. As Bill Belichick explained in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvELlakyOk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a nine-minute press conference answer</a> to a question about long snappers in September, special teams units have truly become that — <em>units</em>, in which kickers, long snappers and punters (who are almost always also holders) work together throughout practices and devote themselves wholly to working as one.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“That kind of whole unit has really evolved into, you know, specified snapper or a specified kicker, a specific punter, and generally the punter as the holder, so the three of those guys could work together all practice because they’re all available,” Belichick said. He assessed that friendlier field surfaces and indoor stadiums have helped, too.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s made kicking operations smoother, and sometimes you can see the effects on a given play. Gould’s winner at Lambeau, for instance, depended on a brilliant hold by punter Mitch Wishnowsky, who 20 years earlier might have ceded the job to a backup quarterback. With other responsibilities, that QB may have spent less time practicing holding — and may have failed to get the ball down for Gould’s right leg, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPuhwAIzrYk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as Tony Romo once did</a> on a must-make playoff field goal attempt:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\\n<div class=\"non-jetpack-embed embed-youtube\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Robbie Gould GAME-WINNING Field Goal To SHOCK The Packers! | 49ers vs Packers Divisional Round\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hazQi3EePbs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">That kind of competence isn’t just a playoff thing, at least not this season. NFL kicking units have become nails on pressure kicks in general. In the 2021 regular season, they were 71-for-83 in the final two minutes (85.5 percent) of the fourth quarter. That’s easily the most makes and attempts in those situations of any season since at least 2000, even when adjusted for the league’s new 17-game schedule. And the 85.5 percent make rate on those kicks is the second-best this century, behind only 2003 (87.8 percent).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">This year’s haul included a 10-for-16 mark on 50-plus yarders in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter. One was a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiQzvwvPzHc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">record-breaking 66-yarder</a> from the Baltimore Ravens’ Justin Tucker that beat the Detroit Lions as time expired in Week 3. It’s worth wondering how long that mark, as the longest field goal ever, will stand. If an attempt like that one were to come in the Super Bowl, it would be awfully difficult not to assume the kicker was about to drill it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><em>Check out our latest </em><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/?ex_cid=endlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>NFL predictions</em></a><em>.</em></p>\\n]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Alex Kirshner]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Alex Kirshner\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-kirshner/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    Figure Skating Is A Lonely Sport.

Do you like star power and ferocious defense? The Los Angeles Rams could be the team for you. Or would you prefer a youthful underdog with explosive offensive talent? We might suggest rooting for the Cincinnati Bengals.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">In this unconventional matchup, let’s dive into what <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our Elo forecast model</a> sees in store on Super Bowl Sunday, as well as the numbers behind why either team could engineer a championship victory.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 id=\"nfc-no-4-l-a-rams-vs-afc-no-4-cincinnati\"><strong>NFC No. 4 L.A.

(Those 20 career All-Pro selections for the Rams make them just the fifth Super Bowl team with at least that many on their roster through the season in question since 1980.)<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"20\" href=\"#fn-20\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The others were the 2012 San Francisco 49ers, 2007 New England Patriots, 2002 Oakland Raiders and 1980 Raiders.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-20\">20</sup></a> While the Rams are in their prime — their average <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160736/https://www.footballperspective.com/2016-av-adjusted-team-age-overall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Approximate Value-weighted age</a> of 27.6 is roughly the same as that of the typical Super Bowl team (27.4) since 1980 — the Bengals (25.8) are the youngest Super Bowl team in that span, one of just three teams to make the big game with an average age under 26.0.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"21\" href=\"#fn-21\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining the 1981 49ers and 2013 Seattle Seahawks &mdash; admittedly good company!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-21\">21</sup></a> Beyond the advantage in veteran talent and know-how, the Rams have produced a better point differential against a tougher schedule this season, which explains why Los Angeles is solidly ahead of the Bengals <a href=\"https://masseyratings.com/nfl/ratings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in</a> <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most</a> <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/team-efficiency/2021/totals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">of the</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predictive</a> <a href=\"https://sagarin.usatoday.com/2021-2/nfl-team-ratings-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">power</a> <a href=\"http://www.dolphinsim.com/ratings/nfl/index_pred.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rating</a> <a href=\"http://massey-peabody.com/nfl-2021-power-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">systems</a>. Across those seven linked ratings, L.A. has an average leaguewide ranking of 3.3, while Cincinnati’s is 11.0.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">And in perhaps the most pertinent X’s-and-O’s factor of the Super Bowl, quarterback Joe Burrow and the Bengals’ aerial attack will have a difficult matchup in the form of Los Angeles’s passing defense. Against the pass, the Rams rank sixth in schedule-adjusted <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/8379024/nfl-explaining-expected-points-metric\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expected points added</a> (EPA) per game, after finishing <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/opp.htm#passing::23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fourth</a> in adjusted net yards per attempt allowed and <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/opp.htm#passing::21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fifth</a> in sack rate during the regular season. According to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32176833/2021-nfl-pass-rushing-run-stopping-blocking-leaderboard-win-rate-rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ESPN’s pass-blocking and pass-rushing metrics</a>, the Rams were the league’s No. 1 pass-rushing team, and the Bengals were the league’s third-worst pass-blocking team. So Burrow, the NFL’s <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing.htm#passing::24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most-sacked QB</a> this year, might be in for a long night against Aaron Donald, Von Miller, Leonard Floyd and the rest of L.A.’s fearsome front seven.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The inverse probably won’t be true for Matthew Stafford on the other side of the ball — L.A. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32176833/2021-nfl-pass-rushing-run-stopping-blocking-leaderboard-win-rate-rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranked No. 1</a> in pass-blocking and Cincy <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32176833/2021-nfl-pass-rushing-run-stopping-blocking-leaderboard-win-rate-rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranked just 25th</a> in pass-rushing. And the more time Stafford has to survey the field for the receiving duo of Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr. (who <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201300ram.htm#player_offense\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">combined for 255 yards in the air</a> in the NFC championship game and are averaging over 200 combined receiving yards per game this postseason), the more likely it is that Cincinnati’s Super Bowl dream turns into a nightmare.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><strong>Why the Bengals can pull the upset: </strong>For all their youth and inexperience, the Bengals still have electric talent. Burrow, running back Joe Mixon and wide receivers Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins became the first quartet of offensive teammates aged 25 or younger to all produce 10 or more AV for a Super Bowl team <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/1984_roster.htm#roster::11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">since the 1984 Miami Dolphins</a>, and just the third ever. And despite some of the starker differences between the two teams’ resumes, many of Cincinnati’s regular-season stats barely differed from L.A.’s. The teams scored exactly the same number of points (460), and the Rams allowed only 4 fewer (372 versus 376). Burrow and Stafford had <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing.htm#passing::28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">almost identical</a> adjusted net yards per attempt rates, to go with extremely similar rates of touchdown passes and interceptions per attempt. All of which points to this matchup not being as lopsided as the names involved may suggest. Cincinnati has already pulled upsets of two teams <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/tgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=game&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=vegas_line&amp;year_min=2021&amp;year_max=2021&amp;game_type=P&amp;team_id=cin&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;week_num_min=0&amp;week_num_max=99&amp;temperature_gtlt=lt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">favored by at least 4 points</a> over them (the Titans and Chiefs), so a third is hardly out of the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">There are valid concerns about Burrow being under pressure all game long. However, he might be able to turn the Rams’ defensive tactics against them. In generating all that pressure, L.A. has blitzed 32.3 percent of the time in the playoffs, forcing opposing passers into an 18.1 raw Total Quarterback Rating overall and a miniscule 8.9 raw QBR against the extra rusher(s). But Burrow has an 82.5 QBR against the blitz this year (including playoffs), which ranks fourth among all passers, and he has the fourth-largest gap in QBR (+26.8 points) when blitzed versus not blitzed.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"22\" href=\"#fn-22\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, Stafford has the second-largest gap (+28.8), but the Bengals have only blitzed about half as often (16.2 percent) in the playoffs as the Rams.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-22\">22</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">On the other side of the ball, the Rams have often relied on Stafford’s heroics late in games to pull out the win — he has an 83.4 QBR in the fourth quarter this season, tops among all NFL QBs (and about 19 points higher than his overall adjusted QBR) — but the Bengals have shown an ability to adapt and shut down opposing passers as games go on this postseason. In the playoffs, Cincinnati has gone from allowing a QBR of 69 in the first halves of games to just 9 in the second halves (or overtime), often by employing fewer pass-rushers and more defenders in coverage. If the Bengals can use that tendency to short-circuit Stafford’s clutch play, don’t be shocked if Cincy’s huge edge in special teams (they’re No. 3 in EPA, versus No. 28 for L.A.) makes a difference in a close game.

The young figure skater had just brought down the house with his long program set to music from “Riverdance,” and this performance, which helped earn him a spot on the <a href=\"https://www.teamusa.org/road-to-sochi-2014/features/2014/january/12/meet-the-2014-us-olympic-figure-skating-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2014 U.S. Olympic team</a>, went viral, turning the 19-year-old with a ponytail into a fan favorite. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">A lot has happened in the nearly eight years since Brown’s breakout performance at Boston’s TD Garden. He cut off his ponytail, for one. He’s been to the world championships <a href=\"http://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00012123.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">four times</a>, placing as high as fourth. He won the 2015 U.S. national title. And this week, he’s competing in the Olympics for the second time in his career. But the quad that Bezic predicted would come? It hasn’t.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">To be sure, Brown has landed quads in practice. In November, he even <a href=\"https://www.teamusa.org/News/2021/November/20/Jason-Brown-Lands-Quadruple-Jump-To-Win-Grand-Prix-Medal-In-France\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">landed one in competition</a> that was certified as fully rotated. Points for persistence — falls on that jump are not what you’d call gentle — but his hit-to-miss ratio on competition quads is lopsided in favor of falling or under-rotating. Brown may hit a quad in Beijing, and I sincerely hope he does — not because I need him to do one, but because I’d love to see his decadelong effort rewarded. Brown seems to want to do the jump well, and consistently well. As a longtime fan, I want for him what he wants for himself.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But quads aren’t what <em>fans</em> want from Brown. Perhaps they’d like him to clear that particular hurdle so he has a chance to get on the podium at the Olympics or in the world championships, but they don’t think less of his skating for its lack of quads. The absence of quads in his programs and his resultant placements is testament not to what Brown is missing but to what most of the other skaters don’t seem to possess — or don’t possess to the same degree: exquisite musicality, deep engagement with the audience and a mastery over his blade. That Brown continues to rank in the <a href=\"http://www.isuresults.com/ws/ws/wsmen.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top 10 internationally</a> also serves as a reminder of all the ways most of his competitors are lacking in some regard. Without Brown around, fans — especially the younger ones or those without memories like an elephant — would probably not realize anything was missing from the other programs. </p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/maame-biney-rediscovered-olympic-dream-leaving-abusive-coach-82610922</p>\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But that appreciation alone won’t change Brown’s circumstances: The quad, and <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-quad-jump-revolution-has-transformed-womens-figure-skating-how-far-will-it-go/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lots of them</a>, is nonnegotiable at this point in men’s figure skating. Brown’s failure to land a quad nearly cost him a spot on the 2022 Olympic team. He placed fourth at nationals after falling on his one quad attempt, a salchow, but he was still awarded the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/figureskating/story/_/id/33026793/ice-skating-pairs-team-alexa-knierim-brandon-frazier-join-national-champs-ashley-cain-gribble-timothy-leduc-olympics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">third and final U.S. Olympic spot</a>, somewhat controversially. He was taken ahead of the nationals’ second-place finisher, 17-year-old Ilia Malinin, who goes by “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/quadg0d/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quadg0d</a>” on Instagram — which is not at all blasphemous because his quads are really that good. (Is there only one “quad god” or several? Or is it a holy trinity kind of situation? Help me, I’m Jewish.) The <a href=\"https://www.usfigureskating.org/sites/default/files/media-files/2022%20Winter%20Olympic%20Games%20Selection%20Procedures%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">selection criteria</a>, which took into account the past two years of competition, made choosing Brown for the berth not only possible but likely, though a strong argument could have been made in Malinin’s favor. The teenager from Virginia is clearly the future of American skating and a mega-talent that should be cultivated and encouraged, which means being given competitive opportunities. Get this kid’s feet wet in major competition, get him in front of judges, have him be ready to take over from Nathan Chen when the three-time world champion chooses to retire. Had U.S. Figure Skating gone this route, it would’ve been a defensible decision. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">My purpose here, however, is not to relitigate the selection of Brown over Malinin; it’s fairly obvious the decision suits the sentimental part of me. This is the place from which I watch Brown perform, and it’s the place from which I write this piece.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“Why do some athletes draw this sort of response, this bodily love that is sometimes out of proportion to their actual world standing,” Patricia Lockwood <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/31/magazine/winter-olympics-figure-skating-jason-brown.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote about Brown</a> in 2018. That year, he was just an alternate for the Olympic team after a lackluster long program at nationals.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">I’m sure there’s an element of rooting for the underdog at play, and without quads, Brown certainly is that in the world of men’s figure skating. Several of the top skaters would have to make major errors before Brown would have a realistic shot at the podium. But there’s more to it than that. Usually underdogs have a scrappy quality, a rough-around-the-edges aesthetic, but Brown doesn’t project that kind of image. He leans into his edges as he glides across the ice. He holds his shoulders down, keeps his chin up, elongating his neck. Brown cuts far too beautiful a figure on the ice to ever be truly scrappy.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“Beauty is not the goal of competitive sports, but high-level sports are a prime venue for the expression of human beauty,” David Foster Wallace wrote for <a href=\"https://ialjs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wallace_FedererAsReligiousExperience_NYTimes_20Aug2006.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The New York Times</a> in 2006 about the experience of watching Roger Federer play tennis.\\xa0\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But beauty and grace, regardless of how present and plentiful, are not often invoked in connection to men’s sports. “Men may profess their ‘love’ of sports,” Wallace wrote, “but that love must always be cast and enacted in the symbology of war: elimination vs. advance, hierarchy of rank and standing, obsessive statistics, technical analysis, tribal and/or nationalist fervor, uniforms, mass noise, banners, chest-thumping, face-painting, etc.” Wallace, a former tennis player himself, could certainly get technical in his dissection of Federer’s game when the Swiss legend was in his prime, but he seemed to prefer the metaphysical to explain what had happened on the court. For Wallace, this was a more satisfactory way of thinking about Federer’s game and his uncanny abilities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">While men’s figure skating certainly doesn’t shy away from beauty and the discussions thereof, there is also a strong desire to defend the sport’s place in the pantheon of athletics, even though men’s and women’s figure skating were among the very first “winter” sports brought into the Olympics in 1908, before the Winter Games themselves even existed. (Every four years, it seems there’s an ill-intentioned take that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/21767077/figure-skating-needs-transition-costumes-uniforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">questions skating’s bona fides as a sport</a>, usually on aesthetic grounds. <em>How can it be a sport if the athletes wear costumes?</em>) One of the ways skating’s athletic credentials are established is by parsing the discipline along technical lines, with discussions of required elements, scoring records, grade of executions and, say, how many quads one might attempt in a program. This way of analyzing skating is certainly important and useful. It helps distinguish different skaters and rank them, and sorting people into winners and losers is one of the main purposes of competition. It also has the unfortunate effect of reducing a performance to the sum of its parts.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">In discussing what he felt was wrong with the current scoring system, which was implemented after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympics_figure_skating_scandal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">judging scandal</a> at the 2002 Olympics, two-time world champion and 1968 Olympic silver medalist Tim Wood told the <a href=\"http://skateguard1.blogspot.com/2014/04/interview-with-tim-wood.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skate Guard blog</a>: “You know in high school when you dissected a frog in biology class? At the end of the dissection, it’s not a frog anymore, now is it? When you award more points for grabbing your skate and putting it behind your head than doing a spin well, you’ve completely missed the point of what figure skating is about.”\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">For many fans, Brown is what men’s figure skating is about — the edge quality, the glide, the musicality, the beauty — and the current system doesn’t have a way to reward him for what he does so well out on the ice. His whole is greater than the sum of the parts, but the current scoring system is a “sum of its parts” kind of project. There’s a lot of truth to that, but it also ignores the way in which the <a href=\"https://www.usfigureskating.org/about/scoring-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Judging System</a> has allowed him to remain competitive and in the top 10 in the world over the past eight years, even without a quad, by milking as many points as possible out of the program components score, which is the updated way of saying “artistic impression.” Brown has received many, many perfect marks in the components category. It’s just that these stellar scores aren’t enough to overcome the quad-point deficit. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"><p data-paragraph=\"main\">Brown is hardly the first skater to be held back by a technical limitation. In the 1970s, skaters like Toller Cranston saw their title hopes dashed by weak performances in the school figures, though they were arguably the best free skaters of their time. (The figures were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/09/sports/no-more-figures-in-figure-skating.html?pagewanted=print\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eliminated in 1990</a>.) Cranston, like Brown, was known for his extraordinary artistry and performance quality; along with John Curry, the 1976 Olympic champion, Cranston helped revolutionize men’s figure skating into something far more expressive than what it had been during the post-war period. Brown seems a fitting heir to Cranston’s artistic legacy. In an interview with Russian media, Brown spoke of trying to push the boundaries artistically. “I’m focused on developing this part of our sport,” he said.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">His “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y47DE8gRvM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sinnerman</a>” short program is proof of this mission and its success. Since he debuted it nearly two years ago for the 2020-21 season, the program has been <a href=\"https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/04/13/jason-brown-rohene-ward-sinnerman-program-alvin-ailey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">widely regarded as an instant classic</a> by figure skating fans. Set to Nina Simone’s rendition of the song, it is a step up creatively from anything that Brown has ever done before in his long senior career, which is saying something since Brown has more than a couple of hits along the way.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Drawing from the choreography and Horton technique in the “Sinnerman” portion of Alvin Ailey’s masterpiece “Revelations,” the ambition of this piece is undeniable. Most figure skating programs typically aspire to an idea of “beauty” or being “crowd-pleasing,” which are certainly great things for a skater and choreographer to aspire to. The “Sinnerman” program is certainly both of those things, but there is more there than pleasure for both performer and spectator. There is a strong artistic point of view behind the music choice and the choreography. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Rohene Ward, Brown’s longtime choreographer, explained that nearly two years ago, the skater came to Chicago from his training base in Toronto, where he currently works with two-time Olympic silver medalist Brian Orser and Olympic bronze medalist Tracy Wilson, to get new programs. This was around the time we saw nationwide protests against racism and police violence in response to George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police. “Jason and I had never really spent a ton of time talking about social things just because we were always working on the ice,” said Ward, the first Black choreographer to be named “<a href=\"https://usfigureskatingfanzone.com/news/2021/2/17/figure-skating-the-tapestry-that-is-rohene-ward.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Choreographer of the Year</a>” by the Professional Skaters Association. (He has received this honor twice.) But around choreography sessions in 2020, Ward and Brown, who is Jewish and white, finally had the conversation that many in the country were having at the time. “We really got to talk about his feelings and … creatively where we were in space and time,” Ward said\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“Our body language was different, and the story we wanted to tell from this was very different from where we came from in the past,” he continued. “It was really to show strength and to show power and to show unity.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“Some people would question why is he [Brown] getting ‘Sinnerman,’ and is it appropriate for him to skate to [it],” Ward asked before answering the question himself: “Absolutely, it’s appropriate for him to skate to, and he should be skating to this.”\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">For Ward, Brown was the only skater who could pull this off — perhaps aside from the choreographer himself, who was an incredible performer during his competitive career. “I knew that Jason was really the only person that I could put this on,” Ward said — the only skater currently competing who could take Ailey’s technique to a steel blade and a sheet of ice. The way it manifests in Brown’s program is in the arms, held at 90-degree angles during turns; leaning on his edge, his leg stretched to the side with his arms straight and by his ears; when he jumps into a nearly stag position before dropping to the ice on one knee.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">As with many of Brown’s most beloved programs, the idea for the “Sinnerman” short program came to Ward in a vision. “I saw his final pose, I saw everybody standing, and I was just like, ‘This is what you’re going to skate to at the Olympics,’” he recalled. Ward described a similarly religious experience with choreographing Brown’s breakout “Riverdance” program. “I was such a believer in it,” Ward said. And then with the zeal of a convert, he set out to make believers of Brown and his coach at the time, Kori Ade, too. “I made him a believer, and then he made everybody else a believer.” Brown’s long program at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbK9AleFM_k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2014 national championships</a>, which helped him place second and make the Olympic team, was a mass conversion event. The program started slow and soft but built in intensity and speed, simply never letting up. By the time the four-and-a-half-minute program was over, Brown was skating at a sprint and the arena was in raptures. People jumped to their feet before he even finished his final scratch spin. The video of that program soon went viral, turning people who hadn’t been in TD Garden or watching on TV at home into believers, too. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Since that debut, Brown (along with Ward) has continued to proselytize to the skating masses, though subsequent programs weren’t as splashy as the one that put him on the map. Ward said it was a deliberate choice to not retread the “Riverdance” terrain. “We’re just going to keep growing and expanding and becoming more iconic,” Ward said of the development of Brown’s style on the ice since his early days in the senior ranks.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“We were never going to get stuck in a genre. We were always going to try something new and push the boundaries and test the waters,” he continued. “He [always] came to me with an open mind, open body, open spirit.” Ward said there were only a couple of times when he and Brown disagreed over the music selection and direction of a program. One of those times came during the 2016-17 skating season. Ward chose a very simple piano piece called “The Scent of Love” for Brown’s long program. Brown was worried that it was too slow compared with his previous programs and that spectators would get bored, but Ward thought it was the right time to pull back and strip down, letting Brown’s superb skating speak for itself. There were none of the bells and whistles of “Riverdance.” Brown’s performance was simple and poignant. His head, how he held it, where he gazed, did much of the expressive work of this piece. As he stepped off the ice after the piece at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4zigd9jRkI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skate America</a>, cameras focused on one woman, who appeared to be working at the event, moved to tears by the performance. “It was so beautiful,” she told Brown, who gave her a hug before joining his coach in the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_and_cry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kiss and cry</a>.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">This is hardly an unusual reaction to Brown’s skating, but athletic dimensions of artistry are often forgotten when speaking about the American skater and his performance. “The pace and the cadence to keep up [with the music] the entire time, to keep that energy, that hustle … this man is running, and to keep that up for two minutes and fifty seconds at this pace is very, very difficult for him, let alone anybody. But he does it. Because of how he trains, he makes it look effortless,” Ward said, referring this time to Brown’s “Sinnerman” program. “They want to talk about how pretty he is, but they don’t want to talk about how powerful he is, regardless if he does quads or not.” Ward thinks most of the other top skaters would be hard-pressed to pull off the intricacies that Brown can with seeming ease. “These boys, they couldn’t do it if they tried.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">And it’s hard to fathom Brown, even if he had mastered the quad salchow, being able to skate a program as taxing and as complex as “Sinnerman” with that jump. His transitions from choreography to jump then back to skating seem virtually impossible with a quad in the mix. (Or perhaps I’m underestimating his cardiovascular fitness.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“As I work so hard to build my technical content, I’m not willing to lose that amazing performance quality that I, you know, instantly fell in love with,” Brown <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNtC36JK6M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in a recent International Skating Union video. “Technical content” is undoubtedly a euphemism for quad jumps. Brown’s comments are a clear articulation of priorities. Yes, he’d like to be able to add a quad to his programs, but not at the expense of artistry.

One of the biggest underachievers of the Tokyo Games (with 13.7 fewer medals than expected) was the host, Japan, whose expectations were set in part by assuming a home-country “bounce.” The <a href=\"https://duresport.com/2014/03/06/olympic-medals-the-host-nation-bounce-is-real/amp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">host-nation boost</a> at the Olympics is well-documented, but last summer’s Games were held under abnormal pandemic conditions with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/world/asia/tokyo-state-of-emergency-olympics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spectators kept out of most events</a>. A greatly reduced crowd <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/beijing-olympics-2022-tickets-not-on-sale-to-general-public-will-only-be-offered-to-selected-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">will be expected in Beijing</a> as well. In response to this, we cut our previous host-country-bounce effect in half — which happens to roughly correspond to what Japan’s relatively modest boost was last summer.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The other change involves Russia — err, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Olympic_Committee_athletes_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Russian Olympic Committee</a> (“ROC”). After a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2020-russia/olympics-russia-to-compete-under-roc-acronym-in-tokyo-as-part-of-doping-sanctions-idUSKBN2AJ1UZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doping scandal</a>, ROC athletes were barred from competing under the Russian flag (and some of them were barred from the Games, period). Because of this, we <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-is-on-pace-for-a-lousy-olympics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had generally downgraded</a> Russian medal expectations in our previous trackers, assuming the sanctions would harm the ROC’s ability to rack up medals. However, that was clearly not true in Tokyo. Contrary to our tracker’s modest expectations, the ROC <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/summer/2020/medals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">finished third in the medal table</a>, beating our pre-Olympics projection by a whopping 18 medals (the biggest “miss” — high or low — for any country). Thus, we removed any “doping penalty” from the ROC for the Beijing Games.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Even though this remains a simple medal tracker relative to baseline expectations — not a full-blown forecast like the ones <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we issue</a> for <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other</a> <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nhl-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sports</a> — those two changes should make those baselines more realistic. Otherwise, we look forward to keeping tabs on Norway, the U.S., Canada and the rest of the top projected countries in the field.</p>]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Neil Paine]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Neil Paine\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/neil-paine/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n     neil.paine@fivethirtyeight.com\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    Americans Are Increasingly Meh On The Olympics\\n   </title>\\n   <link/>\\n   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-arent-more-americans-interested-in-the-winter-olympics/\\n   <dc:creator>\\n    <![CDATA[Kaleigh Rogers and Jean Yi]]>\\n   </dc:creator>\\n   <pubdate>\\n    Fri, 04 Feb 2022 11:00:00 +0000\\n   </pubdate>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Beijing Olympics]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Pollapalooza]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <guid ispermalink=\"false\">\\n    https://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&amp;p=324978\\n   </guid>\\n   <description>\\n    <![CDATA[Did you tune into (or are you currently watching) the opening ceremonies for the Winter Olympics Friday morning?

Did you even realize the opening ceremonies were happening? If not, you’re not alone. Polling shows enthusiasm for the Games is muted, and while the Winter Games <a href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/en/SB-Blogs/COVID19-OpEds/2022/02/02-Erickson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are typically not as popular</a> as Summer Games in the U.S., the fact that the Olympics are being held in China doesn’t help.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">American interest in the Games is lower than it has been in the past. According to an <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/us-and-global-public-attitudes-2022-beijing-winter-olympics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ipsos poll</a> conducted \\u200b\\u200bDec. 23–Jan. 7, 42 percent of adults said they were interested in the upcoming Games, compared with 55 percent ahead of the last Winter Olympics, in 2018. Just 45 percent of American adults said they planned to watch some or a lot of the Olympics, according to a <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/31/beijing-olympics-viewership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 25-27. That’s roughly the same as the percentage who said they planned to watch the Summer Games in Tokyo last year, though that marked a record low for viewership intent according to the pollster.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The reasons for that dip are mysterious and multifaceted. Of those who told Morning Consult that they don’t plan to watch, 65 percent said it was because they aren’t interested in the events, and 57 percent said it’s because they aren’t interested in the athletes (13 percent, meanwhile, blamed the time zone difference). There are likely a number of underlying factors provoking this lack of interest: For one thing, the last Olympic Games were just six months ago, so there may be a bit of event fatigue since the Games are typically spaced out every two years. There’s also been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/sports/tv-ratings-sports.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a general decline</a> in TV ratings for sports in recent years. And, as mentioned above, the Winter Olympics tend to be a tougher sell for American audiences compared with the Summer Games. Meanwhile, 40 percent in the Morning Consult poll said they don’t plan to watch the Olympics this year because they are opposed to China hosting the Games, and 31 percent cited it as a “major” reason.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">This is a politics column, so let’s focus on that stat a bit. Americans’ views toward China have become more chilly in recent years: a Pew Research Center <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey last February</a> found 67 percent of U.S. adults felt very or somewhat “cold” toward China, up from 46 percent in 2018. Among Republicans, those feelings were stronger, with 79 percent of Republicans feeling the chill. In a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/31/more-adults-approve-than-disapprove-of-u-s-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics-few-have-heard-much-about-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pew Research Center survey</a> conducted Jan. 10-17 this year, Americans were more likely to say that, on balance, they consider China a competitor rather than an enemy, but among Republicans that trend reversed: 52 percent of Republicans said China was an enemy, compared with 40 percent who considered the nation a competitor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The choice to host the Games in Beijing has been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/01/20/1074500316/as-the-olympics-near-activists-criticize-chinas-alleged-human-rights-violations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contentious due to China’s human rights record</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/19/break-their-lineage-break-their-roots/chinas-crimes-against-humanity-targeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abuse and violence</a> against ethnic and religious minorities in the country, such as predominantly Muslim Uyghurs. In response to the criticism, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/06/2022-winter-olympics-biden-announces-diplomatic-boycott-beijing/8837884002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Biden administration</a> chose not to send an official delegation to the Games (as did <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nations-holding-diplomatic-boycott-beijing-games/story?id=82461768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a handful of other</a> nations), a kind of “diplomatic boycott.” In a <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/2/2/the-us-diplomatic-boycott-against-the-beijing-olympics-is-popular-with-voters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poll conducted by Data for Progress</a> from Dec. 15-18 (shortly after the boycott was announced), 67 percent of likely voters supported the decision not to send a delegation, and a plurality of American adults either somewhat or strongly approved of the boycott, according to the January Pew survey. But that Pew survey also showed just 9 percent of adults had heard a lot about it. In fact, 45 percent hadn’t heard anything about the boycott at all. Among those who had heard a lot about it, 69 percent approved of the decision. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Some Americans want U.S. corporations to take a stand as well. When asked whether they think “companies should withdraw their advertisements for the February 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in response to human rights violations by the Chinese government,” 54 percent of U.S. adults said probably or definitely yes, according to a <a href=\"https://static.grid.news/NationalTrackingPolls/2201140_topline_GRID_BEIJING_OLYMPICS_Adults_v1_SH.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grid/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 22-23. Just 34 percent of U.S. adults somewhat or strongly support brands or companies sponsoring the Olympics, according to a separate <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/01/olympic-sponsors-china-human-rights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 29-31, while 58 percent would support brands pulling out of the Games. However, brands might be able to win support simply by issuing a statement condemning China’s actions: 55 percent of U.S. adults said they would support such a move. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Notably, though, Americans still stand behind athletes who chose to attend the Games: 63 percent said they support U.S. athletes participating in the Games, according to that Grid/Morning Consult poll. It captures a sentiment that has been commonly expressed in the run-up to the Games: It’s fair to criticize the International Olympic Committee for selecting China as a host, and it’s fair to criticize China for its history. But many argue there’s no need to punish the athletes, for whom the chance to compete at the highest level is often a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. One that, judging by the polling, many Americans won’t see.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 id=\"other-polling-bites\"><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>According to a Jan. 21-24 Data for Progress poll of likely voters, 58 percent said they would support the Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/1/27/a-majority-of-voters-support-biden-striking-a-deal-with-russia-to-avoid-war-in-ukraine\">striking a diplomatic deal with Russia</a> to avoid war with Ukraine. Democrats, in particular, favored diplomacy, with 71 percent in favor. A slight plurality (46 percent) of Republicans agreed. However, when Americans were asked in a Jan. 28-29 ABC News/Ipsos poll about the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/president-biden-continues-lose-ground-american-public\">sending troops to eastern Europe</a> to try to discourage Russia from invading Ukraine, respondents were split: 38 percent said they opposed sending troops, 29 percent supported it and 32 percent said they didn’t know.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans’ views of the economy are still mostly pessimistic. According to a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx\">Jan. 3-16 poll by Gallup</a>, 67 percent said they thought the economy was getting worse versus 29 percent who said it was getting better. They did find one bright spot, though: the job market. A 43 percent plurality predicted that the unemployment rate would decrease over the next six months. In addition, 72 percent said now was a good time to get a quality job — among the highest figures the pollster has recorded since it began tracking the question in 2001.</li></ul><ul><li>The majority of parents of school-age children (67 percent) believe that pandemic-related educational disruptions have put their children <a href=\"https://civicscience.com/majority-of-parents-say-kids-are-behind-academically-right-now-except-for-this-group/\">somewhat or very behind in school</a>, according to a Jan. 19-26 CivicScience poll. And while children from higher-income families <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12187-020-09782-0\">generally perform better in school</a>, parents who made more than $125,000 a year were more likely (80 percent) to believe the pandemic put their children behind educationally than those who made less than $35,000 a year (65 percent).</li></ul><ul><li>While there’s <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index\">widespread support</a> for the Biden administration’s decision to mail free at-home COVID-19 tests to anyone who wants one, fewer than half (47 percent) were able to <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/01/31/who-requested-free-home-covid-tests-government\">successfully request one</a>. In a Jan. 22-25 Economist/YouGov poll, fully vaccinated adults were much more likely to have successfully requested an at-home COVID-19 test (54 percent) compared with those who say they will not get the jab (27 percent). Instead, a majority (70 percent) of unvaccinated adults said they hadn’t tried to request one.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans are largely satisfied with their own lives but dissatisfied with the direction of the country as a whole. Eighty-five percent said they were very or somewhat satisfied with how things were going in their personal lives, while just 17 percent said the same for the United States, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/389375/satisfaction-own-life-five-times-higher.aspx\">according to Gallup</a>. People with an annual household income of $100,000 or more and those who attend religious services weekly were most likely to report satisfaction with their personal lives (at 94 and 92 percent, respectively). While nonwhite people (27 percent) and Democrats (30 percent) were the most likely to be satisfied with the direction of the country, just 12 percent of white people and just 4 percent of Republicans said the same.</li></ul><h2 id=\"biden-approval\"><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1150\" height=\"920\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-324992\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=1400 2x\"></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">According to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">presidential approval tracker</a>,<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"27\" href=\"#fn-27\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-27\">27</sup></a><strong> </strong>41.7 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 52.6 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -10.9 points).

It apparently was successful, but the viewers never see it; while she’s in mid-air, the film cuts to a conversation Lexie is having in a car with her coach, who is berating her for doing the jump. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“Triples may be big crowd pleasers, but to world-class judges, they’re just a piece of show-off acrobatics,” she said. “You can’t win at this game with that kind of crap!”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The film, which came out in 1978, was presumably made around the time that Dorothy Hamill, the woman who launched <a href=\"https://www.today.com/video/dorothy-hamill-s-olympic-win--iconic-bob--and-signature-spin--40-years-later-601068099935\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ten thousand wedge haircuts</a>, won the gold medal at the 1976 Olympics without performing a single triple jump. But by the time “Ice Castles” was in theaters, Linda Fratianne had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/04/archives/miss-fratianne-takes-world-figure-skating-championship.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">won the ’77 world title</a> with a program that contained two different triple jumps. It turned out that Hamill’s triple-less win in 1976 was the last of its kind for a female figure skater.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The fictional coach in Ice Castles was wrong about the triples: They were precisely the kind of “crap” you needed to win medals in women’s figure skating at that time. But if you transported her and her dialogue to 2022, part of what she said would ring true: At these upcoming Olympics, a female skater can’t win the gold with <em>only</em> triple jumps. She’ll also have to do quads.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The current quad revolution in women’s figure skating got off the ground in 2018 when Russian skater Alexandra Trusova started showing off a quad salchow in the junior ranks. She soon added a <a href=\"https://www.isu.org/inside-single-pair-skating-ice-dance/figure-skating-other/news-fs/12019-trusova-rus-makes-history-with-two-quads-in-golden-performance?templateParam=15\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quad toe loop</a> and then a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEfXWyLHJFI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quad lutz</a>. That same year, Trusova’s teammate Anna Shcherbakova also competed quads in her programs, en route to the <a href=\"https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/12/28/anna-shcherbakova-evgenia-medvedeva-russia-figure-skating-nationals-championships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Russian national title</a>, but a few months later, Trusova bested her for the <a href=\"https://www.goldenskate.com/2019/03/quad-queen-trusova-defends-junior-world-title/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">world junior gold</a>. Both Shcherbakova and Trusova were too young to compete in the senior division in 2019, and the world title was won by 2018 Olympic gold medalist Alina Zagitova, but Elizabet Tursynbaeva of Kazakhstan became the first senior woman to <a href=\"https://olympics.com/en/video/elizabet-tursynbaeva-i-can-t-believe-i-landed-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">complete a quad</a> at those worlds, and she took home silver. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">By the 2020-21 season, Shcherbakova and Trusova, now seniors, took <a href=\"https://www.goldenskate.com/2021/03/2021-worlds-ladies-free-skate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first and third</a>, respectively, at the world championships in Sweden. Shcherbakova fell on her quad flip; in her long program, Trusova competed five quads (though not all were clean) and stormed into third place all the way from 12th. Sandwiched between these two youngsters was Russian teammate Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, who, while capable of a quad, didn’t do any at the event, though she did two triple axels in her program, a relatively rare feat in women’s skating.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1032\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-RussianQuads.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Shcherbakova, Alexandra Trusova and Kamila Valieva\" class=\"wp-image-324818\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-RussianQuads.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-RussianQuads.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-RussianQuads.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-RussianQuads.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-RussianQuads.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>With their jumping prowess, Russia’s Anna Shcherbakova, Alexandra Trusova and Kamila Valieva are favorites to sweep the podium in Beijing. <p class=\"photo-credit credits\">DANIEL MIHAILESCU / AFP / Sergei Bobylev / TASS / Oleg Nikishin / International Skating Union / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">The exemplar of the new quad jump trend — if the New York Times<em> </em>Style section needs only three anecdotes to declare a new trend, then three quad jumpers should suffice here — is 15-year-old Kamila Valieva, the newly minted senior who has <a href=\"https://olympics.com/en/news/kamila-valieva-russian-champion-olympic-favourite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dominated the 2021-22 skating season</a> with her mastery of several quad jumps (and a semi-consistent triple axel). Late last year, Valieva set scoring records in the long and short programs. Her point total at the <a href=\"https://olympics.com/en/news/skating-kamila-valieva-record-rostelecom-cup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2021 Rostelecom Cup</a> was higher than the men’s winner despite the fact that women aren’t yet allowed to do quads in the short program. At the recent European Champions, Valieva, Shcherbakova and Trusova <a href=\"https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/2022-european-figure-skating-championships-results-russians-sweep-kamila-valieva-dominates-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">went 1-2-3</a> with their quads, a result that could be replicated in Beijing.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Reading this sequence of events, it may seem like the women’s quad revolution has happened rather quickly. And it has, in a way: At the last Olympics, no woman performed a quad, and this year potentially all three women’s medalists will have them in their programs.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But the quad’s arrival to figure skating has also been a long time coming, perhaps even overdue.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s been over 30 years since France’s Surya Bonaly first <a href=\"https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2022/01/26/surya-bonaly-figure-skating-olympics-back-flip-quadruple-jumps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tried to do quads</a> in her programs, and it’s been exactly 20 years since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCNjulsq4w4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miki Ando</a> of Japan was credited with completing a quad salchow as a junior in 2002. Ando, however, didn’t use the jump to win the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/sports/othersports/25skate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2007</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goldenskate.com/2011/04/ando-edges-out-kim-for-world-title/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2011</a> world titles; triple jumps done in combination were enough in those competitions. (Ando attempted the quad at the 2006 Olympics but fell short, in both senses of the phrase — under-rotation and literal falling.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“It’s good that finally, after 30 years, somebody says, hey, we need to step it up and upgrade,” Bonaly recently <a href=\"https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2022/01/26/surya-bonaly-figure-skating-olympics-back-flip-quadruple-jumps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> NBC Olympics. “We cannot just stay forever and do the triples, the same jump over and over for the rest of eternity.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-685191161-1024.jpg\" alt=\"Surya Bonaly jumping\" class=\"wp-image-324829\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-685191161-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-685191161-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-685191161-1024.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-685191161-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-685191161-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>Surya Bonaly of France was a powerful jumper but couldn’t quite land a quad in competition. <p class=\"photo-credit credits\">Jean-Yves Ruszniewski / TempSport / Corbis / VCG via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s difficult to know what impact, if any, a successfully landed quad would have had on Bonaly’s competitive career during the ’90s. The scoring system used then is quite different from what is in place now. When Bonaly competed, the technical scores were capped at 6.0, but now the ceiling on those scores have been raised significantly. The quad might not have meant the same sort of scoring boon to the French skater as it does to the current generation of young Russian women who are threatening to dominate Beijing with iterations of the jump.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Watch any old figure skating program from the ’70s or ’80s on YouTube and read the comments below; you’ll inevitably find at least one that is wistful, yearning for a past era of skating. (Often, there are several.) While there is absolutely nothing wrong with preferring a style of skating from a previous era the way one might prefer music from a different generation — I mean, the music that kids listen to these days, amirite? — this sort of sentiment is peculiar to sports like figure skating and gymnastics. In track and field, for example, there is no yearning for a time when athletes ran slower or jumped lower but embodied some other essential values. The past is regarded as essential to building to the present moment, but not preferable to it. In aesthetically judged sports where performance goes beyond metrics into the realm of values, progress is more fraught, as the reception of jump advances in figure skating has shown. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">On the one hand, people are excited by the possibilities; on the other, they’re anxious about what this progress means for the future of the sport. The current quad revolution in women’s figure skating — like the quad revolution in men’s figure skating that preceded it, and the triple jump revolution that preceded both — means that yet again, figure skating will have to grapple with how to propel the sport while retaining the qualities that make it timeless. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background is-style-dots\" style=\"background-color:#555555;color:#555555\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP68020801035-1024.jpg\" alt=\"Peggy Fleming\" class=\"wp-image-324824\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP68020801035-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP68020801035-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP68020801035-1024.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP68020801035-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP68020801035-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>Peggy Fleming traces the compulsory figures at the 1968 Olympics en route to her gold medal. <p class=\"photo-credit credits\">AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\" class=\"has-drop-cap\">In the early years of competitive figure skating, jumps weren’t the focal point of a performance. Emphasis was placed on school figures that skaters would etch into the ice, demonstrating control over their blades. At different points in the sport’s history, this portion of the event could account for over half a skater’s score. Competitions could be won in the figures and they could be lost in the figures, though spectators seldom got to see this part of the competition because it usually wasn’t televised. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The spectator-friendly part of figure skating was the free program, when the athlete could show off original moves and perform to music. And from the very early days of the sport, skaters performed jumps in those programs.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Jumps have been a part of the sport since at least the 1880s, when Axel Paulsen performed a single version of the forward takeoff jump that bears his name. Ulrich Salchow, a 10-time world champion and the <a href=\"https://www.olympedia.org/event_names/298\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first Olympic champion</a> in men’s figure skating, introduced his eponymous back-inside-edge jump in 1909.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Women lagged behind men when it came to jumping, but not necessarily because they lacked the athletic chops to do the elements. “The athletic components of skating at first were considered inappropriate for female practitioners of the sport,” wrote Ellyn Kestnbaum in<em> </em>“Culture on Ice: Figure Skating and Cultural Meaning<em>.</em>” “In 1920, American Theresa Weld received reprimands for performing a single salchow jump because her skirt would fly up to her knees, creating an image deemed too risque.” When it came to women integrating jumps into their programs, they didn’t just have to overcome gravity and master the skill; they also had to push back against the mores of the time, which included sartorial norms.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1150\" height=\"833\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-Sanja.jpg\" alt=\"Sonja Henie\" class=\"wp-image-324815\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-Sanja.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-Sanja.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-Sanja.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-Sanja.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-Sanja.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>Sonja Henie was the first skating superstar. <p class=\"photo-credit credits\">ullstein bild via Getty Images / George Rinhart / Corbis via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">One figure skater who was instrumental in clearing the way for women to perform more jumps was Norwegian Sonja Henie, skating’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/02/sonja-henie-ice-skating-queen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first global superstar</a>. Kestnbaum suggested that Henie was able to do this because she was so young when she burst onto the scene; she was only 11 years old when she <a href=\"https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/81280\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">competed at the 1924 Olympics</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“As a child, she could properly wear a short skirt and bloomers, as opposed to the ankle length skirts her adult competition wore, and thus, she was able to demonstrate the same kinds of jumps and flying spins performed by the more athletic male skaters,” Kestnbaum wrote. Because of Henie’s youth, she could get away with “improper” comportment and do many of the same things that the men were attempting at the time. With that, she created opportunities for other female skaters to do the same; they had no choice if they were to be competitive with this young phenom.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">As they began to don shorter skirts, female skaters added jumps and other dynamic movements to their repertoires during the years of Henie’s domination — she won three Olympic gold medals and 10 world titles from 1927 to 1936 — and both women and men continued to push the technical boundaries of the sport even after Henie retired to Hollywood to become skating’s first (and really only) movie star. By the time World War II rolled around, men and women were performing double twisting jumps in their programs though this wasn’t a requirement for either gender.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1150\" height=\"767\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-545710909.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Button\" class=\"wp-image-324827\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-545710909.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-545710909.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-545710909.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-545710909.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-545710909.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>American Dick Button performed the first double axel and the first triple jump in competition. <p class=\"photo-credit credits\">von der Becke / ullstein bild via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">When skating competitions resumed after the war, American Dick Button emerged as the <a href=\"https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/84513\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">next big winner</a> in men’s skating, and his jumping prowess played a big role in that. He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbvdlMkJCMo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">performed the first double axel</a> in competition in 1948 — 2 1/2 revolutions to the usual two for the rest of the double jumps — and the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dick-button-wins-second-olympic-figure-skating-gold\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first triple jump</a> in 1952. From there, the men were off to the races, with triple jumps increasingly important for the top male skaters in the world. Some women managed to keep pace with the men. In the early 1960s, Petra Burka <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2015/03/30/petra-burka-made-a-giant-leap-for-female-figure-skaters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">performed a triple salchow</a> to win Canadian nationals and then later, to win worlds in 1965. Around the same time, American Janet Lynn, the 1972 Olympic bronze medalist, also started doing triples in her junior programs.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But women’s jumping continued to lag behind the men, Kestnbaum wrote, “because judging and training of female skaters placed more emphasis on graceful movement while triple jumps carried more weight on the male side of the sport.” While no one would accuse Lynn of not being graceful, she struggled in one fundamental area of skating — figures. All the way into the early ’70s, <a href=\"http://skateguard1.blogspot.com/2015/09/retracing-history-fall-and-rise-of.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">figures still counted</a> for half of a skater’s overall score. Trixi Schuba of Austria dominated women’s skating during this period on the strength of her figures, winning two world titles and the 1972 Olympic gold medal. Schuba, however, was a pretty average free skater. She moved across the ice rather slowly, especially when compared to Lynn, who seemed to zip back and forth. Lynn was considered the best free skater of her generation — and not just by the women: Toller Cranston, the 1976 Olympic bronze medalist for the men, cited Lynn as one of his inspirations. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"726\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Janet-Lynn.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Lynn\" class=\"wp-image-324817\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Janet-Lynn.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Janet-Lynn.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Janet-Lynn.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Janet-Lynn.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Janet-Lynn.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>Janet Lynn at age 14 in the 1968 Olympics.

At the end of the 1971 world championships in Lyon, Lynn failed to medal despite winning the free skate portion with an enchanting, fast-paced and difficult program. The audience in France booed for several minutes until a skating coach told Lynn to go to the edge of the ice and bow to placate them. Lynn’s competitive finishes — and the spectators’ reaction to them — played a big part in the diminishment of the figures. In 1973, their share of the overall score was reduced, and a short program was added to the competition.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“Not to belittle Peggy [Fleming] or Carol [Heiss] or anyone before them, but Janet took figure skating from the young glamorous lady with movie star quality, and took it into Middle America … a little more athletic, and still balletic,” Dennis Lewin told Kelli Lawrence for her book “Skating on Air.” Lewin, a former ABC Sports producer, spent several years helping to bring figure skating into American living rooms. “She started the transition from one to the other.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It would take another Olympic cycle for triple jumps to become an essential component of a winning program. Three years after Lynn retired, Hamill would get her gold without a single triple, but that would be the last time it happened. In the subsequent years, the triple jump would become a fixture in the programs of top female skaters.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background is-style-dots\" style=\"background-color:#555555;color:#555555\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1004\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Zayak-3.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Zayak\" class=\"wp-image-324820\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Zayak-3.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Zayak-3.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Zayak-3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Zayak-3.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-1024-Zayak-3.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>Elaine Zayak at the 1984 Olympics. The “Zayak Rule,” instituted in 1982, caps the number of triples skaters can do in their programs. <p class=\"photo-credit credits\">Heinz Kluetmeier / Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\" class=\"has-drop-cap\">In fact, it only took a year. In 1977, Fratianne won the world title with a clean triple toe loop in her program along with a failed attempt at a triple salchow. (Fratianne is also known for being the skater to bring sparkle to figure skating costumes, so you have her to either thank or admonish for that.) But triples really took off with Elaine Zayak, who used variations of the jump to win the 1982 U.S. national and world titles. At worlds, she did six triple jumps in total, though four of them were triple toe loops. Her achievement is all the more impressive given that when she was 2 years old, Zayak lost three of her toes and part of her foot in a lawnmower accident. Doctors suggested she take up something like skating as a form of physical therapy.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Later in 1982, the International Skating Union (ISU) created a rule saying that a skater couldn’t repeat a triple jump unless it was done in combination with another jump; even then, only two triples could be repeated in this way. The “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/19/nyregion/a-different-strategy-for-going-for-the-gold.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zayak Rule</a>,” which is still in effect, puts a cap on the number of triples (or quads) that skaters can do in their programs. There are six kinds of jumps in the skating arsenal, which means that at most, a skater who can can perform eight triples — six singly and two in combination — in a long program. But if, for example, you have mastered only two jump types, say a triple toe loop and a triple salchow, per the Zayak Rule, you would be able to do only four triples in your long program.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It is worth noting that there were men who also repeated a single triple jump several times in the same program prior to Zayak’s international debut. Scott Cramer, a U.S. figure skater who competed in the late 1970s and early ’80s and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Cramer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">placed as high as fifth</a> at the world championships, also did as many as four triple toe loops in his long program. While it’s reasonable for the ISU to want skaters to show a mastery of the different jump types, it’s hard not to judge the timing of this rule — right after Zayak made a big splash and won the world title with four triple toe loops — as an institutional response to women loading up their programs with triple jumps.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“I look at Elaine as a true transitional figure who changed everything,” said David Michaels, a former TV sports producer who worked behind the scenes on figure skating and gymnastics broadcasts for CBS and NBC, in “Skating on Air.” “There was no beautiful line with her — she was built like a fireplug. But she revolutionized things because of all her triple jumps. … You were on the edge of your seat thinking, ‘Oh my God, this girl is doing WHAT??’ It was fantastic.”\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Though I’m sure Michaels intended for this comment to be wholly complimentary of Zayak and her ability, describing Zayak’s body as a “fireplug” and talking about her lack of line gives the compliment a backhanded feel. And that’s sort of how Zayak and her skating was talked about, especially when she was compared to the other top U.S. skater of this period, Rosalynn Sumners.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Their rivalry wasn’t depicted as merely a contest between two talented skaters who were trying to win competitions. The coverage turned them into avatars for different ideas about what skating could or should be: Zayak represented an athleticism that wasn’t tempered by femininity, and Sumners represented the beauty and elegance that had long been heralded in female skaters. In a 1983 Sports Illustrated story about Zayak and Sumners, the focus was on their respective weights, as evinced in the title, “<a href=\"https://vault.si.com/vault/1983/02/14/the-thinner-was-the-winner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Winner was Thinner</a>.”<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"34\" href=\"#fn-34\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we are, as a society, no less fatphobic now than we were back then, at the very least, one can no longer write about female athletes in this manner without significant pushback. I suppose that’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-34\">34</sup></a> It went into detail about how Sumners lost 17 pounds in eight weeks through severe caloric restriction and then won the 1983 nationals. The article described Sumner as a “fair-skinned, green-eyed beauty,” while Zayak was described as “terrier-like” in her determination and “stocky,” comparing her physique to that of baseball’s Pete Rose.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“This year, Rosalynn would like very much to prove that she can be both athletic and beautiful,” Lorraine Borman, Sumner’s coach told the reporter. “We have four triples in our program, which I think is too many,” she said, sounding a bit like Lexie’s coach in “Ice Castles.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">“The sport’s going through an athletic stage right now,” Fleming, the 1968 Olympic gold medalist, told SI. “I’ve always liked the artistic side, and I think the two sides will have to come closer together. Right now the balance of power is in the hands of the triple-jump people.”\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1150\" height=\"833\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-ZayakSummers.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Zayak and Rosalynn Sumners\" class=\"wp-image-324816\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-ZayakSummers.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-ZayakSummers.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-ZayakSummers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-ZayakSummers.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QUADS-575-ZayakSummers.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>Elaine Zayak, left, and Rosalynn Sumners were pitted against each other as the standard-bearers for athletics vs. artistry. <p class=\"photo-credit credits\">Heinz Kluetmeier / Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">Fleming’s and Borman’s comments posited artistry and athleticism as though they are opposing forces, that “too” much of one means “too” little of the other. But the athletic vs. artistry binary is a false one. A skater moving briskly across the ice, switching from edge to edge and performing choreography that suits the music and connects to the audience is exhibiting athleticism in addition to artistry; and a skater who pops off a high, clean jump that rotates dazzlingly fast during a dramatic passage in the music is being artistic in addition to showcasing athleticism. It doesn’t have to be either/or.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But the athleticism vs. artistry binary isn’t solely about the movements on the ice but about what they signify. For most of skating’s history, perhaps into the present, there has been considerable discomfort around women encroaching on what was perhaps considered men’s turf. In “Figure Skating in the Formative Years: Singles, Pairs, and the Expanding Role of Women,” James R. Hines wrote about a skating book from the 1860s by George Anderson that took a positive view of women’s increasing participation in the sport but set limits on what they should strive for. Back then, figure skaters concentrated primarily on the figures, and Anderson was comfortable with women performing some of the simpler, less risky ones. “After the shamrock, a one foot figure requiring three turns and two changes of edge, ‘the acme of female accomplishment had been reached.’ Figures viewed as more difficult, which required more rapid motion, or in which the chance of falling is greater, were considered unsuitable for women.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Hines wrote that Anderson was primarily concerned with two Fs: falling and femininity (or the lack thereof). The triple jumps that Fleming and others were discussing in the ’80s were quite different from the complex figures being fretted over in Anderson’s day, but over a century after Anderson spelled out his concerns, the anxieties within the skating community remained largely unchanged.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background is-style-dots\" style=\"background-color:#555555;color:#555555\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1013933920-1024.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Orser\" class=\"wp-image-324831\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1013933920-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1013933920-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1013933920-1024.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1013933920-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1013933920-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>Brian Orser of Canada jumping at the 1984 Olympics. <p class=\"photo-credit credits\">Heinz Kluetmeier / Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\" class=\"has-drop-cap\">As Fleming and others were worrying about the number of triples Zayak was performing and what that meant for women’s skating, the men were adding even more triple jumps to their repertoire. In 1978, Canadian Vern Taylor became <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPq24qOCpgU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the first man to do a triple axel</a>, and by the time the 1984 Olympics rolled around, other male skaters like Canada’s Brian Orser were <a href=\"https://olympic.ca/team-canada/brian-orser/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">featuring it in their programs</a>. (1984 Olympic champion Scott Hamilton didn’t do a triple axel in his winning programs, but he was the last male champion to win without that particular jump.) And by the end of the decade, the quad had made its appearance in men’s figure skating. Though it was first <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120129011333/http://www.cbssports.com/u/wire/stories/0%2C1169%2C1675967_10946%2C00.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attempted in competition in 1986</a> by Josef Sabovčík, the ISU later determined that it was not fully rotated. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVecIlHmSG0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first quad jump</a> to be ratified was performed a couple of years later by Canada’s Kurt Browning at the 1988 world championships. When he landed it, Josef Dědič, the vice president of the ISU, said, “The quad will become an everyday event, at least in the men’s category.”\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">That’s certainly true now, but it took more than a decade for the quad to become a regular feature for the men. Browning, the four-time world champion, was surprised at how long it took for the jump to take off (pun intended). “After landing it, I certainly expected more skaters to start doing it in competition. I was surprised in the next few years when that really did not happen,” he <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120129011333/http://www.cbssports.com/u/wire/stories/0%2C1169%2C1675967_10946%2C00.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in 1999.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">\\u200b\\u200bBrowning stopped doing the quad just a few years after he brought it to competition and was no worse off for it competitively; he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/sports/figure-skating-canadian-team-mixes-some-more-gold-with-ice.html?scp=1&amp;sq=browning+figure&amp;st=nyt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">won the 1993 world title</a>, his fourth, without. Fellow Canadian Elvis Stojko upped the ante on the quad, performing them in combination with other jumps. In 1991, he tacked on a double toe loop and in ’97, he combined the quad with a triple toe loop.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Though it took longer than Browning and Dědič expected, the quad jump had become a staple of men’s figure skating by the 2002 Olympics, when all of the men’s medalists <a href=\"https://www.goldenskate.com/2002/02/2002-olympics-mens-figure-skating-highlights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">included at least one</a> in their competitive repertoire. Bronze medalist Timothy Goebel, nicknamed “<a href=\"https://www.teamusa.org/News/2012/February/22/Tim-Goebel-still-Quad-King-10-years-later\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the quad king</a>,” was the first man to do three quads in a single program. Over the course of his career, he landed approximately 76 quads in competition.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">During the time that Browning, Stojko and the rest of the men’s field were toying around with the quad, Japan’s Midori Ito became the first woman to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-11-27-sp-926-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">land a triple axel</a> in competition at the NHK Trophy in 1988, just months after she became the first woman to do <a href=\"https://skatingscene.com/2011/08/02/midori-ito-at-the-adult-worlds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seven triples</a> in the long program. Tonya Harding <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1991/02/17/hardings-7-triples-nail-us-title-put-skating-world-in-whirl/3e847b63-6d16-4c13-b197-9fed67677fdf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">followed her</a> a couple of years later, and both skaters played around with the triple axel in combination with other jumps.

While you had more skaters performing triple-triple combinations — some doing two of the more difficult triples together instead of the back-to-back triple toe loops that were being done in the ’80s — there wasn’t much else to report on. And the triple axel had <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnw/culture/story/_/id/21609322/tonya-harding-seven-other-women-skaters-successfully-landed-triple-axel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">almost completely disappeared</a> from women’s competition. Every once in a while, skaters would come along with the triple axel, but they usually couldn’t do them consistently across several competitions, let alone several competitive seasons. The triple axel became a one-off sort of jump, and it was nowhere near being a prerequisite for a medal as it had become on the men’s side by the late ’80s.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The triple axel didn’t resurface in a major way for women until Japan’s Mao Asada started competing in 2004. Not only could she do a triple axel, she could do more than one in a single program and in combination with other jumps, per the Zayak Rule. Asada consistently performed the triple axel across nearly 10 seasons. During her <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Asada\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">long career</a>, she won the 2008, 2010 and 2014 world titles, as well as the silver medal at the Olympics in Vancouver in 2010. She became only the second female skater to land the triple axel at the Games. But Asada’s achievements, impressive as they may be, didn’t immediately start a trend toward more triple axels in figure skating, and it was still possible to win without one. South Korea’s Kim Yuna, Mao’s chief rival throughout her career, won gold in Vancouver, as well as the world titles in 2009 and 2013 and silver at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, without the triple axel; all she needed were exceptionally well done triple-triple combinations and tremendous speed across the ice.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Another relatively consistent triple axel jumper would enter the fray after Mao’s retirement in 2014: Russia’s Tuktamysheva, who is coached by Alexei Mishin — a man who played a big part in normalizing the quad jump in men’s figure skating through his star pupils, Alexei Yagudin and Evgeni Plushenko. Tuktamysheva used the triple axel to <a href=\"https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2015/03/28/elizaveta-tuktamysheva-wins-figure-skating-world-championship-elena-radionova-gracie-gold-ashley-wagner-polina-edmunds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">win the world title</a> in 2015; at the recent Russian nationals, she performed two triple axels in her long program.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But now, unlike when she won the world title seven years ago, there are many other skaters doing triple axels, including some of her Russian teammates who are performing the jump in programs that <em>also</em> contain quads. Valieva, the overwhelming favorite to win gold in Beijing, does triple axels in her short and long — and in the long, she does quads in combination with triple jumps. In addition to the Russians, Wakaba Higuchi from Japan, Alysa Liu of the U.S. and You Young of South Korea are also able to do triple axels.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Now it’s more than just a skater here or there who can do an ultra difficult quad or triple axel. This, in turn, has created a greater sense of urgency when it comes to learning how to do the jumps. When several skaters are pushing the envelope at the same time, in the same competitions, it’s much harder to envision a scenario where a skater who lacks these jumps will be able to squeeze through for a medal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">As in the past with the jumping trailblazers, there’s a lot of anxiety about the young Russian skaters and their arsenal of quads. Back in 1999, Craig Maurizi, one of Tara Lipinski’s former coaches, recalled the reaction to Zayak, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/19/nyregion/a-different-strategy-for-going-for-the-gold.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saying</a>, “Everybody was amazed at her ability to do those triples, but the knee-jerk reaction was, ‘We can’t have the sport become a jumping contest.’” Replace “triples” with “quads” and you get the gist of how people are feeling about the current generation of jumpers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1150\" height=\"767\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1355678115-575.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Kwan\" class=\"wp-image-324834\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1355678115-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1355678115-575.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1355678115-575.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1355678115-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1355678115-575.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>American Michelle Kwan skates during her long program in the 1998 Olympics. <p class=\"photo-credit credits\">Simon Bruty /Anychance / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph=\"main\">“Whenever the jump bar is raised substantially and rewarded at the expense of other skating skills and ‘presentation,’ once enough skaters can achieve the new top level of jump difficulty, the pendulum then swings back to reward more complete skaters’ skating skills and presentation,” Kestnbaum wrote in “Culture on Ice.” That seemed to be the case after the triple jump revolution: The 1990s into the aughts were witness to many artistically inclined skaters who made it to the top of the podium, including Kristi Yamaguchi, Oksana Baiul, Sasha Cohen and, of course, Michelle Kwan. Perhaps they weren’t always on the cutting edge of jumping, but they successfully combined artistry, skating skills and triples. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s too soon to tell whether the pendulum will swing back toward presentation and skating skills because it’s too soon to know if a critical mass of female skaters will be able to do the quad. The quad mountain is a much steeper climb than the triple hill was. Lipinski, the first woman to do two triple loops in combination during competition, <a href=\"https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2022/01/28/surya-bonaly-figure-skating-olympics-back-flip-quadruple-jumps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commented</a> that she trained for the quad during her elite career and “the falls that I would take were unlike any I’ve ever experienced when I was skating.” (And the jumps that Lipinksi regularly trained to win the Olympic gold at 15 were enough to require major hip surgery before she turned 20.) The jump may never become the norm for top-level female skaters as the triples did in the ’80s. So far, the quad phenomenon appears to be a localized one, with all of the precocious jumpers coming almost exclusively from Eteri Tutberidze’s academy in Russia. (American Alysa Liu briefly competed quads when she was a junior skater but hasn’t been able to do them since growing and entering the senior ranks. Tuktamysheva, who has done quads, comes from the Mishin program.)\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">And so far, with a couple of exceptions, the only skaters who are able to perform quads are 18 or younger. Russian junior skater Sofia Samodelkina gave an interview last month in which she said she hoped that the 2022 Olympic Games would be postponed to 2023 when she would be age-eligible to participate. She doesn’t think that she can hold on until 2026, when her Olympic opportunity will come around. “I will be 17-18 years old. Well, what five quads can be [done] at this age?” she <a href=\"https://fs-gossips.com/sofia-samodelkina-every-night-im-praying-that-the-olympics-are-postponed-to-2023-i-think-this-will-be-my-only-chance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">As many figure skating experts have noted, some of the Russian quad jumpers employ a technique that involves pre-rotation, meaning that they start twisting their upper bodies before they’ve taken off from the ice, which enables the skater to complete four revolutions before landing. This technique is dependent on the skater being small and light, and puts added strain on the back because the skater isn’t using leg strength as much as she should be; and once the skater starts to go through puberty, she tends to lose her jumps since the technique wasn’t sound to start with. These athletes also tend to retire before their 18th birthdays, often citing back injuries as the cause. (Many of the Tutberidze pupils use this technique on their triples as well, which makes even those jumps difficult to maintain after puberty.) </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Rafael Arutyunyan, the coach of Americans Nathan Chen and Mariah Bell — both of whom are competing in Beijing — has openly supported raising the age limit. “When those skaters who had amazed people with their complicated programs went through puberty period, they started facing difficulties on the ice. Instead of coping with those difficulties, they preferred to retire, having talented and slim youngsters snapping at their heels,” Arutyunyan <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/sport/478226-rafael-arutyunyan-figure-skating-champions-plastic-cups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said of</a> 2018 gold and silver medalists Zagitova and Medvedeva. “They simply realized they had no chance to beat skaters with quad jumps.” </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">In early winter 2019, Zagitova, then only 17, announced she was going on a <a href=\"https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/12/13/alina-zagitova-figure-skating/#:~:text=Zagitova%20said%20she%20is%20focusing,according%20to%20a%20TASS%20translation.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">competition hiatus</a>, citing a lack of motivation. But the timing of this announcement is noteworthy; Zagitova unofficially retired right around the time that the quad jumpers aged into the senior ranks. The 2018 Olympic champion had previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/the-russian-dolls-have-transformed-figure-skating-but-at-what-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that she couldn’t train the quad jumps her younger teammates did because she wasn’t thin enough to do them safely: After those Games, Zagitova revealed that she <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/alina-zagitova-says-she-didnt-drink-water-during-the-20-1832459869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">didn’t even drink water</a> in Pyeongchang. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1150\" height=\"767\" src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1237750459-575.jpg\" alt=\"Russian Women\\'s Figure Skating Team\" class=\"wp-image-324833\" srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1237750459-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1237750459-575.jpg?w=1400 2x\" data-src=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1237750459-575.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1237750459-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1237750459-575.jpg?w=1400 2x\"><figcaption>The Russian winners and their coaches at the 2022 European championship.

Arutyunyan himself noted that he’s been worried about this since before Trusova and her quad were a twinkle in the ISU’s eye. Zagitova bumped Medvedeva down to second without a quad; Medvedeva had previously dethroned Yulia Lipnitskaya, one of the stars of the 2014 Olympics. Tuktamysheva aside, no Russian skater of the past decade has managed to go for more than a couple of senior seasons before being surpassed by younger counterparts. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">While raising the age minimum could potentially address that issue — and a few others — it also seems a tad unfair to deny young skaters across the world opportunities to compete just because one country has created a particularly cutthroat talent development system. In previous generations, the skaters would also start out at the elite level very young, too, and it helped to transform the sport — see Zayak’s and Fratianne’s triples when they were 16 — but were able to compete at or near the top for several seasons. Michelle Kwan placed second at nationals in 1994 when she was just 13 and didn’t retire until 2006 after winning two Olympic medals and five world titles. This kind of career doesn’t seem possible, at least when it comes to the Russian skaters.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Despite this very grim situation, it doesn’t feel right to ban the quad, which has been a staple on the men’s side, out of concern. Historically speaking, anxieties over the safety of female athletes have been used to deny women the opportunity to participate in sports, especially ones that were deemed “masculine.” There’s a blade-like thin line between protection and protectionism. We, of course, should be concerned about the physical ramifications of training certain jumps, especially during growth periods when athletes are more susceptible to injury. But we have to be wary of the protectionist impulse that stems from a particular worldview about what women’s figure skating is — and is not — and the determination of some to steer it in a certain way so we end up with the “right” type of winners.\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">For the time being, the future of figure skating is in the hands of the young women who will take the ice over the next few weeks in Beijing. It’s a world that has changed dramatically since “Ice Castles” came out, just as the world was markedly different from the one Henie skated into. But though the fear of the next big change has always been present, the skaters don’t seem to care — they keep skating on the edge.</p>]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Dvora Meyers]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Dvora Meyers\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/dvora-meyers/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    Is Tom Brady The GOATiest Of All The GOATs?\\n   </title>\\n   <link/>\\n   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-tom-brady-the-goatiest-of-all-the-goats/\\n   <dc:creator>\\n    <![CDATA[Neil Paine]]>\\n   </dc:creator>\\n   <pubdate>\\n    Wed, 02 Feb 2022 19:20:50 +0000\\n   </pubdate>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Babe Ruth]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[GOAT]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Michael Jordan]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[MLB]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[NBA]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[New England Patriots]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[NFL]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[NHL]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Tom Brady]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Wayne Gretzky]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <guid ispermalink=\"false\">\\n    https://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&amp;p=324791\\n   </guid>\\n   <description>\\n    <![CDATA[With legendary quarterback Tom Brady officially retiring (yes, we really mean it now), the accolades are pouring in.

There are, um, a lot: The former QB of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tom-brady-retires-with-all-the-records/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had an unbelievable career</a> stuffed with nearly <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradTo00.htm#all_leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">every possible accomplishment</a> — both at the team and individual level. He was so good that each <em>half</em> of his career <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billbarnwell/status/1487520838589075470\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was Hall of Fame-worthy</a> by itself. (Maybe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSSportsHQ/status/1487523588144271361\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">each <em>third</em> was</a>, too!) As a result, Brady is widely regarded as the <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-the-ways-that-tom-brady-is-footballs-goat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">greatest QB in NFL history</a>. But to put his greatness in true perspective, we might have to zoom out from football and compare Brady to the greats from other sports.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">So let’s put Brady up against three icons who are <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/major-league-goat-gretzky-jordan-brady-ruth-b1762489.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">usually held up</a> as the GOATs of the other “Big Four” men’s North American team sports leagues, with apologies to the GOATS of the WNBA and MLS/NWSL, and also to Tiger Woods, Serena Williams, Simone Biles and other GOATs from individual sports.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"35\" href=\"#fn-35\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies as well to all the arguable counter-GOATs out there, from Barry Bonds to LeBron James to Mario Lemieux.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-35\">35</sup></a> We’ll focus on Michael Jordan (NBA), Babe Ruth (MLB) and Wayne Gretzky (NHL) — and render our head-to-head judgments of Brady against each. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">There’s obviously no cross-sport metric to distill each player into a single number. But we don’t need that for this analysis. For each comparison, we’ll be looking at <strong>career stats</strong> and <strong>rate stats</strong> (including both traditional and advanced metrics) as well as <strong>winning</strong> — because, let’s face it, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-the-nbas-ring-chasers-devaluing-the-ring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ring-counting does matter</a> in these debates – relative to each player’s peers within their sport. May the best GOAT win …</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 id=\"brady-vs-jordan\"><strong>Brady vs. Jordan</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><strong>Career stats: </strong>As we <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tom-brady-retires-with-all-the-records/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">noted Tuesday</a>, Brady is the all-time career leader in numerous traditional statistics, including the most cherished of all passing categories: <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_yds_career.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">yards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_td_career.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">touchdowns</a>. (He passed No. 2 Drew Brees in yards <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_yds_career_2020.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last season</a> and in TDs <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_td_career_2019.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two seasons ago</a>.) By comparison, Jordan is neither the all-time NBA leader <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in points</a> — he ranks fifth — nor <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ast_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/trb_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rebounds</a> or any other major counting stat. By the advanced numbers, Jordan fares better; he <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-or-mj-raptor-picks-the-best-nba-players-of-the-past-40-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranks third</a> in career <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-raptor-our-new-metric-for-the-modern-nba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RAPTOR wins above replacement</a>, <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/vorp_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second</a> in value over replacement player and <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fifth</a> in win shares. But Brady is <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/av_career.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No. 1</a> in career <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/approximate-value-methodology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Approximate Value</a> and career QB value over replacement (based on our <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-nfl-predictions-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QB Elo value metric</a>, representing the number of yards a QB generated relative to an undrafted backup),<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"36\" href=\"#fn-36\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for opponent and era by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index9945.html?p=4038&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;translating each QB&rsquo;s stats&lt;/a&gt; from the context of their opponents&rsquo; games against all other opponents that season and into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/NFL/passing.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;typical passing environment&lt;/a&gt; of the 2016 through 2020 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-36\">36</sup></a> defeating all of his peers in total value added.

MJ remains the NBA’s <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all-time leader in points per game</a> (by a fraction of a point over Wilt Chamberlain), and he dominates the advanced leaderboards. He ranks No. 1 in <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/per_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">player efficiency rating</a>, <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws_per_48_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">win shares per 48 minutes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/bpm_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Box Plus/Minus</a> and RAPTOR plus/minus. By comparison, Brady is “only” eighth in both <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_yds_per_g_career.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">yards per game</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_rating_career.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passer rating</a> — and on the advanced side, he’s eighth in QB Elo (relative to average) per start and eighth in <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=pass_adj_net_yds_per_att_index&amp;year_min=1969&amp;year_max=2021&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=1500&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=pass_att&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adjusted net yards per attempt index</a>.

Compared with the entire scope of each league’s history, Jordan owns the battle of rate statistics with Brady.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><strong>Winning: </strong>If there is a winning-based category in the NFL, Brady is likely No. 1 in it. He ranks <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=qb_w&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first in regular-season QB wins</a> (as a starter), with a 31 percent cushion over Nos. 2 Peyton Manning and Brett Favre, and <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=all_td&amp;year_min=1950&amp;year_max=2021&amp;game_type=P&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;is_starter=Q&amp;game_result=W&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;week_num_min=0&amp;week_num_max=99\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first in playoff wins</a>, with 119 percent (!) more than No. 2 Joe Montana.

The only other pro football player who can contend with Brady’s rings is Otto Graham, whose Cleveland Browns <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GrahOt00.htm#passing_playoffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">won seven championships</a> during his career — though four of them were in the AAFC, before the Browns joined the NFL. Jordan <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29365615/what-last-dance-reveals-michael-jordan-legacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is no slouch</a> in the winning department either, of course, but he <a href=\"https://stathead.com/basketball/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=date_game&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2022&amp;is_playoffs=E&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;is_starter=Y&amp;game_result=W\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">started in far fewer victories</a> (regular season and postseason) than all-time NBA leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did and is <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/most_championships.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tied for 10th in NBA history</a> in championships won (with six). Jordan did win a ring in 40 percent of his seasons played, while Brady won in only 35 percent of his seasons as starter,<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"37\" href=\"#fn-37\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, discounting 2000 (before he was a starter) and 2008 (when he missed nearly the entire season with an injury).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-37\">37</sup></a> though the NBA is also <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/index281b.html?p=1881\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">known for producing dynasties</a> and <a href=\"https://harvardsportsanalysis.org/2016/12/which-sports-league-has-the-most-parity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">having the least parity</a> of any major pro league, so Brady’s success rate is arguably more impressive. In the end, Brady was slightly more prolific than Jordan when it came to earning rings, and he lapped the field of his NFL peers in terms of winning games.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 id=\"brady-vs-ruth\"><strong>Brady vs. Ruth</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><strong>Career stats: </strong>The Sultan of Swat played his first game in 1914, just a couple years before Tom Brady made his NFL debut.

With the passage of time, however, those records were surpassed — both by Henry Aaron and later, in the home run department, by Barry Bonds. That leaves Ruth slightly below No. 1 in the most important traditional counting stats, though his career advanced stats remain as impressive as ever. Ruth <a href=\"https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2021&amp;month=0&amp;season1=1871&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;players=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranks first</a> in position-player <a href=\"http://m.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/wins-above-replacement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wins above replacement</a> according to FanGraphs and <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/WAR_bat_career.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second</a> (behind Bonds) in Baseball-Reference.com’s version of the stat. Not surprisingly, he is No. 1 all-time in <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-we-play-nba-jam-with-mlb-teams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our JEFFBAGWELL metric</a> (which blends the two versions of WAR), and that helps put Ruth hot on Brady’s heels in the career-stats category.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><strong>Rate stats:</strong> As imposing as Ruth’s totals are, his rate stats might be even better. Yes, The Babe <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/batting_avg_career.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranks just 13th</a> in career batting average, but he is <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/onbase_perc_career.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No. 2</a> in on-base percentage, <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/slugging_perc_career.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No. 1</a> in slugging — by a nearly 9 percent margin over Ted Williams — and <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/onbase_plus_slugging_career.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No. 1</a> in OPS. In advanced stats, Ruth is also the all-time leader in <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/onbase_plus_slugging_plus_career.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adjusted OPS+</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2021&amp;month=0&amp;season1=1871&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;startdate=1871-01-01&amp;enddate=2021-12-31&amp;sort=18,d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weighted runs created plus</a>. According to Bill James’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runs_created\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Runs Created formula</a>, a lineup of nine Babe Ruths would score 12.9 runs per game, which also ranks No. 1 in MLB history. Compare that with Brady’s great-but-not-the-greatest per-game and per-attempt metrics, and it’s clear Ruth wins this battle of rate statistics.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><strong>Winning: </strong>Ruth’s New York Yankees are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderers%27_Row\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generally regarded</a> as the canonical example of an unbeatable baseball team, with a <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/1927-roster.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">silly number of Hall of Famers</a> spread across the roster. And even among that star-studded group, Ruth <a href=\"https://www.fangraphs.com/warleaders.aspx?season=1927&amp;team=all&amp;type=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was the star of stars</a>. It translated into 1,455 wins for games Ruth started as a batter during the regular season, which <a href=\"https://stathead.com/baseball/game_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=gmatchCar&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=HR&amp;year_min=1901&amp;year_max=2021&amp;class=player&amp;type=b&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;exactness=anymarked&amp;GS=GS&amp;GF=anyGF&amp;location=pob&amp;locationMatch=is&amp;WL=W&amp;temperature_max=120&amp;wind_speed_max=90\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranks 20th all-time</a> (in part because schedules were shorter in Ruth’s era, and in part because Ruth pitched early on). Ruth is also <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_most_rings.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tied for seventh all-time</a> in most championships, with a Brady-esque seven rings, and he <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_most_rings.shtml#most_rings::3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">would rise to a tie for third</a> if we require players to appear in the World Series for their rings to “count.” Those championships are comparable to Brady’s tally, particularly when we consider that MLB tends to have more parity than the NFL — although the Yankees’ dynasties of the pre-expansion era were probably exceptions to that overall rule. (Yogi Berra is the MLB leader in titles won with 10, which surpasses even Brady’s ring count.) Since Ruth won a lot but was not <em>the</em> clear-cut biggest winner in his sport, we have to give Brady the nod here.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 id=\"brady-vs-gretzky\"><strong>Brady vs. Gretzky</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><strong>Career stats: </strong>If anyone’s raw output can compete with Brady’s, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-belated-birthday-tribute-to-wayne-gretzky-and-his-ridiculous-stats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it’s the Great One</a>, Wayne Gretzky. Remember Brady’s top billing in yards and TD passes? His edge over No. 2 Brees is 5.2 percent in the former and 9.3 percent in the latter. Meanwhile, Gretzky’s edge over No. 2 Gordie Howe <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/goals_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in goals</a> is 11.6 percent and his lead over Jaromír Jágr <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/points_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in points</a> is an astonishing 48.7 percent. The <a href=\"https://www.sportscasting.com/wayne-gretzky-would-still-be-the-nhls-all-time-leader-in-points-if-he-never-scored-a-single-goal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oft-repeated stat</a> that Gretzky would be the all-time NHL leader in points if he never scored a single goal, on the <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/assists_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">strength of his assists</a> alone, is too jaw-dropping to even become a cliché. (Gretzky leads in assists over No. 2 Ron Francis by a margin of 57.2 percent!) That is <em>far </em>more dominant <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/most-amazing-statistical-achievement-in-us-sports-history/621329/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relative to the competition</a> than Brady’s career tallies are. And Gretzky’s more advanced totals are nothing to sneeze at, either. He would <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/points_adjusted_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">still be the No. 1 point-scorer in history</a> even after <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/about/adjusted_stats.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adjusting</a> for the offensive era in which he played. Gretzky is also the <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/ps_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most valuable player in NHL history</a> according to both Hockey-Reference.com’s <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/about/point_shares.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Point Shares</a> and the WAR derived from position-relative <a href=\"https://hockey-graphs.com/2016/07/13/measuring-single-game-productivity-an-introduction-to-game-score/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Game Score</a>.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"38\" href=\"#fn-38\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A holistic performance metric that incorporates not just scoring but also on-ice team goals and shot attempts, blocked shots, faceoffs and other categories.

And by that standard, Gretzky still ranks as one of the most prolific players in the sport: He is No. 1 in career <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/points_per_game_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">points per game</a>, No. 1 in <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/assists_per_game_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assists per game</a> (no surprise) and No. 8 in <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/goals_per_game_career.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goals per game</a>. Those ranks drop some if we use stats that adjust for position and era, however. <a href=\"https://stathead.com/hockey/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=games_played&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;threshhold=5&amp;pos=S&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;locationMatch=is&amp;rookie=N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Among skaters</a> with at least 500 games played, Gretzky ranks sixth in Point Shares per game, and relative to position average, Gretzky’s Game Score of +1.05 is slightly behind Bobby Orr (+1.08) and Mario Lemieux (+1.06). That probably places Gretzky somewhere below Jordan and Ruth’s utter domination of the rate-statistic leaderboards, but it still leaves him above Brady.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><strong>Winning: </strong>Gretzky’s Edmonton Oilers were a <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nhl/2016/04/19/nhl-dynasties-chicago-blackhawks-edmonton-oilers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bona fide dynasty</a> in the 1980s, <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">winning four Stanley Cups</a> in a five-year period from 1984 to 1988. Gretzky went on to lead his next team, the Los Angeles Kings, to another Cup final appearance in 1993 (though the Kings <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvbG1qTC_QE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lost to the Montreal Canadiens</a>), and he was on a few more competitive teams with the St. Louis Blues and New York Rangers down the stretch of his career.

Brady beats Jordan in at least one category (career stats) and <em>probably </em>in winning, too — as hard as that judgment is to render against MJ, the <a href=\"https://www.marca.com/en/more-sports/2020/11/09/5fa93180268e3e4e648b461c.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most maniacal winner</a> in sports history. Brady also has the upper hand over Ruth as a winner, and <em>probably</em> in terms of career stats as well (though it’s close). The only adversary against whom Brady does not defeat in either career or rate statistics is Gretzky, though Brady has the largest edge of the competition over the Great One in the category of team success. In the end, the lack of a major weakness in any of the areas we examined means Brady has a very strong case for being the GOAT of GOATs. But we all know this debate will never be settled — nor should it be, as arguments like these are the lifeblood of the very sports that Brady, Jordan, Ruth and Gretzky all excelled in.</p>\\n]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Neil Paine]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Neil Paine\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/neil-paine/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n     neil.paine@fivethirtyeight.com\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    The Americans Finally Won Curling Gold In 2018.

Between the men’s and women’s teams, the U.S. had <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Curling_Championships#Men\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">won only once</a> at the World Curling Championships since 1978 (a women’s title <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_World_Women%27s_Curling_Championship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 2003</a>), and it had previously earned just one curling medal of any type at the Olympics (a men’s bronze <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics#Men\\'s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 2006</a>). After taking that bronze, the American men foundered on the Olympic stage, finishing last <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2010_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_tournament#Standings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 2010</a> and second-to-last <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2014_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_tournament#Round_robin_standings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 2014</a>. Going into the 2018 Olympics, they <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180208235122/https://worldcurling.org/worldrankings/#tabs-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were ranked fourth</a> in the world, solidly trailing No. 3 Norway and sitting <em>far</em> behind Nos. 1 and 2, Canada and Sweden.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Nor did the tournament seem to be breaking the U.S.’s way early on. The team <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2018_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_tournament\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lost four of its first six games</a> to open the round-robin stage, seemingly dashing any hopes of taking home a medal at all — much less winning gold. But after three straight wins (including one over Canada) to close out the round-robin and advance on a tiebreaker, the U.S. proceeded to defeat both of the top-two teams in the world — Canada again, and then Sweden — to claim gold in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/team-usa-curling-win-gold-medal-2018-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dramatic fashion</a>. “We’ve played our best when our backs were up against the wall,” American curler Tyler George <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetorch/2018/02/24/588477615/u-s-mens-curling-takes-on-sweden-in-the-gold-medal-final#:~:text=Music%20Of%202021-,U.S.%20Men\\'s%20Curling%20Team%20Wins%20Gold%2C%20Beating%20Sweden%2010%2D7,it%20all%20in%20South%20Korea.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> after the win. “[F]or five days, we were the best team in the world, and we did it at the right time.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Most fairy-tale runs end on that high note. U.S. curling, however, will get to add another chapter to its story this month at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Whether it will be as successful as the original depends on a lot of factors — not least of which is how much 2018’s breakthrough was merely a one-off, or rather the start of something bigger for America in this <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-entertainment-sports-nhl-nfl-dd063544d37d488188a2ec3956cef465\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cult-favorite winter sport</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The gold medal seemed to pique more sustained American interest in the sport, at least at first. Curling normally <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/america-loves-curling-until-it-forgets-about-it-for-four-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sees an every-four-year “bump”</a> in attention, as casual Olympic viewers first tune in out of curiosity, then out of addiction — yes, the action is legitimately engrossing — but eventually forget about the game until the next Olympic cycle. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, though, U.S. curling officials <a href=\"https://www.mesabitribune.com/news/local/a-cult-sport-a-gold-medal-a-meteoric-rise/article_0b23a682-13cc-11ea-8186-cf52a2c21a93.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were reporting a greater increase in participation</a> than usual, with more members at the club level and more facilities in which to play. <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2012-12-27%202022-01-27&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F01yfj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to Google Trends</a>, curling-related searches in America were up by nearly 3 percent in the two years following the 2018 Olympics, compared with the two years after the 2014 Olympics.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Like everything else, that upward trajectory has been complicated by the pandemic. Curling clubs across North America had to suspend activities to prevent the virus from spreading, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_World_Men%27s_Curling_Championship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high-level curling tournaments had to be canceled</a>, and curling-related search traffic was down by more than 6 percent in the two years leading up to the 2022 Olympics, relative to the same period heading into 2018. Whatever momentum curling had built in the U.S. after the gold-medal victory was doubtless slowed by COVID-19, although there’s no way to know if it was negated completely.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But regardless of whether a breakout for the next generation of U.S. curlers was put on hold by the pandemic, the men’s team representing America’s repeat bid for gold will be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_tournament#Teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stocked with familiar names</a> from the current generation. John Shuster, captain of the 2018 team — and author of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D7luILD1UY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gold-sealing shot</a> against Sweden — will return as skip, joined by Matt Hamilton and John Landsteiner as well. Chris Plys, who went to the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver as an alternate, and two-time U.S. curling champion Colin Hufman round out the roster.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">The betting markets don’t have much faith in the U.S.’s ability to repeat as champions. Depending on which outlet you look at, the Americans’ odds vary <a href=\"https://www.gamingtoday.com/news/2022-winter-olympics-odds-betting-beijing-games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">from +1000</a> (or a 9 percent <a href=\"https://www.aceodds.com/bet-calculator/odds-converter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">implied probability</a> before adjusting for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigorish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the take</a>) to <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2952905-olympics-predictions-2022-medal-odds-for-usa-russian-athletes-and-more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">+1100</a> (8 percent) <a href=\"https://www.vegasodds.com/news/winter-olympics-odds-mens-womens-curling-events-vegas-odds-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">or</a> <a href=\"https://www.olympicbettingodds.com/winter/curling.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">+1400</a> (7 percent). All of those odds have the U.S. ranked fifth in the Olympic field, a dip from its first-place finish from 2018. Is that regression warranted, though?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">According to Ken Pomeroy’s <a href=\"https://doubletakeout.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">curling ratings</a>,<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"39\" href=\"#fn-39\" data-footnote-content=\\'&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Pomeroy — who is &lt;a href=\"https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/19045118/college-basketball-how-ken-pomeroy-former-weatherman-changed-cbb-betting-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;best known&lt;/a&gt; as the godfather of advanced analytics in college basketball — &lt;a href=\"https://doubletakeout.com/blog/1-lets-talk-curling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;also maintains a site&lt;/a&gt; with curling predictions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\'><sup id=\"ss-39\">39</sup></a> Team Shuster currently ranks <a href=\"https://doubletakeout.com/men\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11th-best in the world</a>, though it ranks fifth among teams going to the Olympics. (Canada and Great Britain are so good at curling that they have numerous teams among the top 10 in the world.)<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"40\" href=\"#fn-40\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The skip, or captain, of one of those teams — Ross Whyte of Scotland — will be an alternate for Great Britain’s Olympic team, skipped by Bruce Mouat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-40\">40</sup></a> So it’s not surprising to see it at No. 5 in the betting odds as well, indicating that it will probably need to overachieve again in 2022 to claim a second consecutive medal, much less another gold.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Instead, perhaps it’s the women’s turn for their own Olympic breakout this time around. Though the U.S. has never earned a women’s medal in curling, it hasn’t been for lack of anticipation: A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2002_Winter_Olympics#Women\\'s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fourth-place finish</a> at the Olympics in 2002, a gold medal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_World_Women%27s_Curling_Championship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at the 2003 world championship</a> and a silver at the worlds <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_World_Women%27s_Curling_Championship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 2005</a> led to <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2005-11-29-voa46/293777.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high expectations</a> for the future. But what followed was a letdown. The Americans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics#Women\\'s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">went a disappointing 2-7</a> in the round-robin stage to finish tied for eighth out of 10 entrants in 2006; four years later, they <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2010_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_tournament\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">duplicated that record</a> to finish dead last; then they went 1-8 for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2014_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_tournament\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another last-place showing</a> in 2014. However, they <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2018_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_tournament\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improved to 4-5</a> in 2018, finishing in a four-way tie for fifth place — and more recently, they <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_World_Women%27s_Curling_Championship#Bronze_medal_game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">won the bronze medal</a> at the 2021 worlds, defeating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_World_Women%27s_Curling_Championship#WCF_ranking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No. 1 -ranked Sweden</a> to earn that distinction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">With <a href=\"https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/11/21/curling-olympic-trials-women-tabitha-peterson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sisters Tabitha and Tara Peterson</a> leading the way (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_tournament#Teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">along with</a> Nina Roth, alternate Aileen Geving and Becca Hamilton, Matt’s sister), the U.S. women have momentum on their side once again. In fact, Team Peterson <a href=\"https://doubletakeout.com/women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranks higher relative to the world</a> in Pomeroy’s ratings (10th) than Team Shuster does on the men’s side.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"41\" href=\"#fn-41\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, the U.S. ranks seventh relative to the other teams heading to the Olympics — but it does rank ahead of Jennifer Jones’s Canadian side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-41\">41</sup></a> But will it translate to a medal, at long last? According to an average of <a href=\"https://www.olympicbettingodds.com/winter/curling.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">various</a> <a href=\"https://www.pinnacle.com/en/curling/olympic-women/matchups/#futures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online</a> <a href=\"https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/en/winter-sports/curling-women-s-winter-olympics-2022-betting-12420256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">odds</a>, the Americans <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TXTHz4jMHDAwJvV95rmX4U4yDgTMbcRIpI6BZdRsWBI/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have about an 8 percent chance</a> to win gold before adjusting for the take, which ranks sixth behind Canada, Sweden, Great Britain, Switzerland and Japan. Those aren’t great odds, but they are no worse than those faced by their counterparts on the men’s side en route to glory in 2018.</p>]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Neil Paine]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Neil Paine\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/neil-paine/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n     neil.paine@fivethirtyeight.com\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n  <item>\\n   <title>\\n    Maame Biney Rediscovered Her Olympic Dream After Leaving An Abusive Coach\\n   </title>\\n   <link/>\\n   https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/maame-biney-rediscovered-her-olympic-dream-after-leaving-an-abusive-coach/\\n   <dc:creator>\\n    <![CDATA[Michael Tabb and Meghan McDonough]]>\\n   </dc:creator>\\n   <pubdate>\\n    Wed, 02 Feb 2022 11:00:40 +0000\\n   </pubdate>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[2022 Beijing Olympics]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[2022 Winter Olympics]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Beijing Olympics]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Featured video]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Maame]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Speedskating]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[The Mental Games]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Video]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <category>\\n    <![CDATA[Winter Olympics]]>\\n   </category>\\n   <guid ispermalink=\"false\">\\n    https://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_videos&amp;p=324756\\n   </guid>\\n   <description>\\n    <![CDATA[Maame Biney was the first Black woman to make it onto the U.S. Olympic Speedskating team.

The shadow cast by his postseason success is enormous. In a league designed to <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/talkoffame/nfl/the-patriots-are-immune-to-nfl-parity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promote parity</a>, Brady-led teams made the championship game in nearly half of the seasons he stepped on the field, winning Super Bowls in three different decades.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">When Brady’s teams got to the big game, he made his appearances count, winning a record five Super Bowl MVP awards.

His Patriots teams hold the record for fewest points by a winning team (13 against the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII) and most points by a losing team (33 against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII). Brady won a Super Bowl without scoring a touchdown (Super Bowl LIII), and he owns a share of the record for the longest scoring drive (96 yards against the Giants in Super Bowl XLVI). Brady appeared in so many championship games compared to his peers, it becomes difficult to contextualize: He <em>lost</em> as many Super Bowls as Cowboys Hall of Fame quarterback <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AikmTr00.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Troy Aikman appeared in</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">In the playoffs, when a single loss sends a team home for the year, Brady dominated.

To equal <a href=\"https://stathead.com/tiny/TS003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brady’s playoff win total</a>, you’d need to combine the careers of second-place Joe Montana (16), third-place Terry Bradshaw (14) and Hall of Famer Len Dawson (5). He started 47 playoff games, and owns the NFL record for postseason <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_yds_career_playoffs.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passing yards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_cmp_career_playoffs.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">completions</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_td_career.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">touchdowns</a>.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Winning in the postseason naturally requires winning in the regular season, and Brady’s <a href=\"https://stathead.com/sharing/zBOlO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">243 regular-season wins</a> as a starter are an NFL record. They’re also 57 wins more than Brett Favre and Peyton Manning, who share second place. Brady’s lead over Favre and Manning is so large that if the NFL ever does something silly like create an award for QB Wins, they’ll have no choice but to name it The Tom Brady. The 31 percent jump from Favre and Manning to Brady is 8 percentage points more than <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/W_career.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cy Young’s</a> lead over second-place Walter Johnson in career wins in Major League Baseball.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Over the course of all that winning through 22 seasons, Brady accumulated regular-season records in many of the same areas he did in the postseason. Thanks in part to his incredible longevity, Brady holds the all-time marks in regular-season completions (7,263), passing yards (84,520) and touchdown passes (624). His 15 Pro Bowl selections are first all-time, and his three league MVP awards are tied for second.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Brady’s total career value is historic as well: His <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/av_career.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Approximate Value</a><a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"42\" href=\"#fn-42\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximate Value is a metric that attempts to put a single value on the career of an NFL player.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-42\">42</sup></a> of 316 ranks first in NFL history.

Today, though, it’s fairly uncontroversial to say that Brady is the GOAT. But among those who still doubt Brady’s place atop the QB pantheon, the things they point to most often are Brady’s efficiency stats. The Adjusted Net Yards per Attempt Index (ANY/A) accounts for sacks and interceptions as well as yards and touchdowns, expresses them on a per-attempt basis and adjusts for era. On this view of quarterback value, Brady is still incredible, <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=pass_adj_net_yds_per_att_index&amp;year_min=1969&amp;year_max=2021&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=1500&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=pass_att&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tied for eighth all-time</a>, but he isn’t the top dog.<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"43\" href=\"#fn-43\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That honor belongs to Patrick Mahomes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-43\">43</sup></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s a similar story for QB Elo, our measure of quarterback value at FiveThirtyEight. When we index QB Elo to league average to account for era, Brady ranks eighth all-time. If we plot the rolling four-game average of Brady’s QB Elo vs. average over his career and compare it to that of Manning,<a class=\"espn-footnote-link\" data-footnote-id=\"44\" href=\"#fn-44\" data-footnote-content=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is our top ranked QB.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\"><sup id=\"ss-44\">44</sup></a> we see that although Brady and Manning share a similar career progression, Manning was more efficient.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\\n<div class=\"non-jetpack-embed \"><iframe title=\"Manning was regularly more efficient than Brady\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-dyVM7\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dyVM7/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"450\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">Brady’s start to his career was rockier than Manning’s. Perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising considering Brady was picked 199th and Manning was taken first overall. A first-round pick probably should be ahead of a sixth-rounder developmentally early in their respective careers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">But Brady did eventually catch up with Manning. Both peaked between the 110th and 120th games of their careers: <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/clt/2004.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Manning in 2004</a> when Reggie Wayne, Marvin Harrison and Brandon Stokley caught more than 1,000 yards and at least 10 touchdowns each, Brady during the Patriots’ <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2007.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">undefeated regular season</a> in 2007 with Randy Moss. And, when the end was near, both saw swoons.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">It’s striking, though, that while Manning’s career fell off of a cliff, Brady managed to rebuild his game after a dramatic late-career decline in New England. He would eventually <a href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/19/five-things-to-know-about-tom-bradys-new-team-the-tampa-bay-buccaneers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reinvent himself in Tampa Bay</a> with a new coaching staff and receiving corps, and return not just to his old form but win a seventh and final Super Bowl last season.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\">And it’s that winning that defines and elevates Brady. After all, the goal of football is to win championships. The quarterback is the player most responsible for winning those games. And no one has ever won like Brady.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-paragraph=\"main\"><em>Neil Paine contributed research.</em></p>\\n]]>\\n   </content:encoded>\\n   <dc:contributor>\\n    <![CDATA[By Josh Hermsmeyer]]>\\n   </dc:contributor>\\n   <atom:author>\\n    <atom:name>\\n     Josh Hermsmeyer\\n    </atom:name>\\n    <atom:uri>\\n     https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/josh-hermsmeyer/\\n    </atom:uri>\\n    <atom:email>\\n    </atom:email>\\n   </atom:author>\\n  </item>\\n </channel>\\n</rss>\\n'"

It provides a generic description of Systems Engineering (SE) as it should be applied throughout NASA. A goal of the handbook is to increase awareness and consistency across the Agency and advance the practice of SE. This handbook provides perspectives relevant to NASA and data particular to NASA. The coverage in this handbook is limited to general concepts and generic descriptions of processes, tools, and techniques. It provides information on systems engineering best practices and pitfalls to avoid. There are many Center-specific handbooks and directives as well as textbooks that can be consulted for in-depth tutorials. This handbook describes systems engineering as it should be applied to the development and implementation of large and small NASA programs and projects. NASA has defined different life cycles that specifically address the major project categories, or product lines, which are: Flight Systems and Ground Support (FS&amp;GS), Research and Technology (R&amp;T), Construction of Facilities (CoF), and Environmental Compliance and Restoration (ECR). The technical content of the handbook provides systems engineering best practices that should be incorporated into all NASA product lines. (Check the NASA On-Line Directives Information System (NODIS) electronic document library for applicable NASA directives on topics such as product lines.) For simplicity this handbook uses the FS&amp;GS product line as an example. The specifics of FS&amp;GS can be seen in the description of the life cycle and the details of the milestone reviews. Each product line will vary in these two areas; therefore, the reader should refer to the applicable NASA procedural requirements for the specific requirements for their life cycle and reviews. The engineering of NASA systems requires a systematic and disciplined set of processes that are applied recursively and iteratively for the design, development, operation, maintenance, and closeout of

content=\"This handbook is intended to provide general guidance and information on systems engineering that will be useful to the NASA community. It provides a generic description of Systems Engineering (SE) as it should be applied throughout NASA. A goal of the handbook is to increase awareness and consistency across the Agency and advance the practice of SE. This handbook provides perspectives relevant to NASA and data particular to NASA. The coverage in this handbook is limited to general concepts and generic descriptions of processes, tools, and techniques. It provides information on systems engineering best practices and pitfalls to avoid. There are many Center-specific handbooks and directives as well as textbooks that can be consulted for in-depth tutorials. This handbook describes systems engineering as it should be applied to the development and implementation of large and small NASA programs and projects. NASA has defined different life cycles that specifically address the major project categories, or product lines, which are: Flight Systems and Ground Support (FS&amp;GS), Research and Technology (R&amp;T), Construction of Facilities (CoF), and Environmental Compliance and Restoration (ECR). The technical content of the handbook provides systems engineering best practices that should be incorporated into all NASA product lines. (Check the NASA On-Line Directives Information System (NODIS) electronic document library for applicable NASA directives on topics such as product lines.) For simplicity this handbook uses the FS&amp;GS product line as an example. The specifics of FS&amp;GS can be seen in the description of the life cycle and the details of the milestone reviews. Each product line will vary in these two areas; therefore, the reader should refer to the applicable NASA procedural requirements for the specific requirements for their life cycle and reviews. The engineering of NASA systems requires a systematic and disciplined set of processes that are applied recursively and iteratively for the design, development, operation, maintenance, and closeout of systems throughout the life cycle of the programs and projects.\" name=\"citation_abstract\"/>\\n  <meta content=\"\" name=\"citation_us_federal_intramural_article\"/>\\n  <meta content=\"8/24/2013\"

and information on systems engineering that will be useful to the NASA community. It provides a generic description of Systems Engineering (SE) as it should be applied throughout NASA. A goal of the handbook is to increase awareness and consistency across the Agency and advance the practice of SE. This handbook provides perspectives relevant to NASA and data particular to NASA. The coverage in this handbook is limited to general concepts and generic descriptions of processes, tools, and techniques. It provides information on systems engineering best practices and pitfalls to avoid. There are many Center-specific handbooks and directives as well as textbooks that can be consulted for in-depth tutorials. This handbook describes systems engineering as it should be applied to the development and implementation of large and small NASA programs and projects. NASA has defined different life cycles that specifically address the major project categories, or product lines, which are: Flight Systems and Ground Support (FS&amp;GS), Research and Technology (R&amp;T), Construction of Facilities (CoF), and Environmental Compliance and Restoration (ECR). The technical content of the handbook provides systems engineering best practices that should be incorporated into all NASA product lines. (Check the NASA On-Line Directives Information System (NODIS) electronic document library for applicable NASA directives on topics such as product lines.) For simplicity this handbook uses the FS&amp;GS product line as an example. The specifics of FS&amp;GS can be seen in the description of the life cycle and the details of the milestone reviews. Each product line will vary in these two areas; therefore, the reader should refer to the applicable NASA procedural requirements for the specific requirements for their life cycle and reviews. The engineering of NASA systems requires a systematic and disciplined set of processes that are applied recursively and iteratively for the design, development, operation, maintenance, and closeout of systems throughout the life cycle of the programs and projects.\\n         </mat-card-subtitle>\\n         <!-- -->\\n         <mat-card-content _ngcontent-sc233=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content\">\\n

handbook is intended to provide general guidance and information on systems engineering that will be useful to the NASA community. It provides a generic description of Systems Engineering (SE) as it should be applied throughout NASA. A goal of the handbook is to increase awareness and consistency across the Agency and advance the practice of SE. This handbook provides perspectives relevant to NASA and data particular to NASA. The coverage in this handbook is limited to general concepts and generic descriptions of processes, tools, and techniques. It provides information on systems engineering best practices and pitfalls to avoid. There are many Center-specific handbooks and directives as well as textbooks that can be consulted for in-depth tutorials. This handbook describes systems engineering as it should be applied to the development and implementation of large and small NASA programs and projects. NASA has defined different life cycles that specifically address the major project categories, or product lines, which are: Flight Systems and Ground Support (FS&a;GS), Research and Technology (R&a;T), Construction of Facilities (CoF), and Environmental Compliance and Restoration (ECR). The technical content of the handbook provides systems engineering best practices that should be incorporated into all NASA product lines. (Check the NASA On-Line Directives Information System (NODIS) electronic document library for applicable NASA directives on topics such as product lines.) For simplicity this handbook uses the FS&a;GS product line as an example. The specifics of FS&a;GS can be seen in the description of the life cycle and the details of the milestone reviews. Each product line will vary in these two areas; therefore, the reader should refer to the applicable NASA procedural requirements for the specific requirements for their life cycle and reviews. The engineering of NASA systems requires a systematic and disciplined set of processes that are applied recursively and iteratively for the design, development, operation, maintenance, and closeout of systems throughout the life cycle of the programs and projects.&q;,&q;title&q;:&q;NASA Systems Engineering Handbook&q;,&q;stiType&q;:&q;SPECIAL_PUBLICATION&q;,&q;distribution&q;:&q;PUBLIC&q;,&q;submittedDate&q;:&q;2013-08-24T08:36:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;stiTypeDetails&q;:&q;Special Publication (SP)&q;,&q;technicalReviewType&q;:&q;TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE&q;,&q;modified&q;:&q;2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;id&q;:20080008301,&q;publications&q;:[{&q;submissionId&q;:20080008301,&q;isbn&q;:&q;978-0-16-079747-7&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;7202815aaf53404aa8209e30b41bb43b&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2007-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;20080008301.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20080008301/downloads/20080008301.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20080008301/downloads/20080008301.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20080008301/downloads/20080008301.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true},&q;G./api/citations/20080008301?&q;:{&q;body&q;:{&q;copyright&q;:{&q;licenseType&q;:&q;NO&q;,&q;determinationType&q;:&q;GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED&q;,&q;thirdPartyContentCondition&q;:&q;NOT_SET&q;},&q;subjectCategories&q;:[&q;Engineering (General)&q;],&q;exportControl&q;:{&q;isExportControl&q;:&q;NO&q;,&q;ear&q;:&q;NO&q;,&q;itar&q;:&q;NO&q;},&q;created&q;:&q;2013-08-24T08:36:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;distributionDate&q;:&q;2019-08-26T18:48:43.9730000+00:00&q;,&q;otherReportNumbers&q;:[&q;NASA/SP-2007-6105 Rev1&q;],&q;center&q;:{&q;code&q;:&q;HQ&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;Headquarters&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;f0865a34ba1f474d865ab51f212fc69f&q;},&q;onlyAbstract&q;:false,&q;sensitiveInformation&q;:2,&q;abstract&q;:&q;This handbook is intended to provide general guidance and information on systems engineering that will be useful to the NASA community.
