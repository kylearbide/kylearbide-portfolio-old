## EMSE6574 Programming For Analytics Code Sheets

**Assignment 1**

*If, Else* Create functions to register and finds students. Using the student ID's, create functions to add and drop classes for students

**Assignment 2**

*Data Structures* Transform the student database into a normalized form using primary keys. Then convert the data into serialized form and output a list of student, course enrollment, and Washington D.C. students.

**Assignment 3**

*List Comprehension* Practice exercises for list comprehension from W3 Schools.

**Assignment 4**

*Pandas* Perform some descriptive statistics on steps-bmi data for men and women.

**Assignment 5**

*Merging and Joining* Take datasets for candidates and committees and combine them to find which committees commited to which candidates. Then perform some exploratory analysis on the location and parties of the candidates and committees.

**Assignment 6**

*Distance Matricies* Use Eucledian and Cosine distances to create a recomendation algorithm from any dataset.

**Assignment 7**

*Dot Product* Create a function that calculates the dot product of vectors and matricies from scratch. Use the functions to create distance metrics from scratch. Apply them using One Hot encoding.

**Assignment 8**

*Linear Regression* Using the sklearn linear regression function, take the diamonds dataset and fit a regression model. Be able to predict if a diamond is under or over priced.

**Assignment 9**

*Logistic Regression* Using the sklearn logistic regression and random walk function, fit a logistic model to the titanic dataset. Predict if a passanger survived the accident based on the independent variables in the dataset.
