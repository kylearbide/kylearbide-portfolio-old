  <summary>Marketing Analytics (EMSE 6035)</summary>
  <p>An introduction to choice-based regression for marketing analytics. This course was taught by John Paul Helveston. Other learning objectives included learning to wrangle and visualize data in R, designing surveys to obtain informative data about consumer preferences, and communicating analysis results in terms of design insights. For the course project, my group performed an design analysis for ticketing packages during the world cup, which included designing and collecting survey data, data pre-processing and visualization, and analysis of attribute and willingness to pay coefficients.</p>

  <summary>Database Management Systems for Data Analytics (CSCI 6907)</summary>
  <p>This course was taught by Dr. Joel Klein. The learning outcomes for this course include learning the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, understanding what database best suit a problem, manipulating data in each type of database, integration of databases into data pipelines, and exploring the benefits of cloud services. The assignments for this course include one project for each MondoDB, PostgresSQL, and Arango databases. For my final project, I transformed a dataset of reddit posts and comments into a graph representation using ArangoDB and Docker.</p>

  <summary>Applied Machine Learning Analysis (EMSE 6575)</summary>
  <p>This course was taught by Dr. Benjamin Harvey. The learning outcomes for this course included selecting and applying the most appropriate algorithms to real world data, evaluating the quality of algorithms, and understanding the principals of each algorithm, to better understand where they to and don't apply. The assignment topics consisted of data gathering and processing, regression, classification, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. Our final project explored using machine learning to gain a competitive edge on forecasting stock prices. Some of our strategies for this project included classification algorithms (logistic regression, naive bayes, and random forest), principal component analysis, and k-fold cross validation. </p>

  <summary>Data Analytics Introduction and Practicum (SEAS 6401)</summary>
  <p>This course was taught by Dr. Benjamin Harvey. The goals for this course included explaining data science, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and their applications. This included working with Python and R, as well as with Apache Spark APIs including PySpark and Spark SQL. The assignments included working with Delta Lake and TensorFlow through Databricks to build and train deep learning models. The course included a variety of guest lecturers who provided their own experiences with machine learning application and integration. My final project for this course was an exploratory analysis of PGA player data, including a regression model to predict tournament performance by player.</p>
