#### Intro to Big Data and Analytics (CSCI 6444; Spring, 2022; Grade: A)

This course was taught by Professor Stephen Kaisler. The objectives of this course included introducing Big Data concepts, issues, and challenges, working with Big Data tools, and understanding advanced analytics including complex problems facing business, society, and engineering. The assignments in this course consisted of Graph Analytics, Clustering & Predictive Analysis, and Text Analytics. For my term paper, I conducted a literature review on how Big Data is used in crime analysis and forecasting.

#### Database Management Systems for Data Analytics (CSCI 6907; Spring, 2022;        Grade: A)

This course was taught by Dr. Joel Klein. The learning outcomes for this couse include learning the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, understanding what database best suit a problem, manipulating data in each type of database, integration of databases into data pipelines, and exploring the benefits of cloud services. The assignments for this course include one project for each MondoDB, PostgresSQL, and Arango databases. For my final project, I tranformed a dataset of reddit posts and comments into a graph representation using ArangoDB and Docker.

#### Applied Machine Learning Analysis (EMSE 6575; Spring, 2022; Grade: A)

This course was taught by Dr. Benjamin Harvey. The learning outcomes for this couse included selecting and applying the most appropriate algorithms to real world data, evaluating the quality of algorithms, and understanding the principals of each algorithm, to better understand where they to and dont apply. The assignment topics consisted of data gathering and processing, regression, classification, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. Our final project explored using machine learning to gain a competitive edge on forecasting stock prices. Some of our strategies for this project included classification algorithms (logistic regression, naive bayes, and random forest), principal component analysis, and k-fold cross validation.

#### Data Analytics Introduction and Practicum (SEAS 6401; Fall, 2021; Grade: A)

This course was taught by Dr. Benjamin Harvey. The goals for this course included explaning data science, exploratory data analysis, satistical modeling, and their applications. This included working with Python and R, as well as with Apache Spark APIs including PySpark and Spark SQL. The assignments included working with Delta Lake and TensorFlow through Databricks to build and train deep learning models. The course included a varierty of guest lecturers who provided their own experiences with machine learning application and integration. My final project for this course was an exploratory analysis of PGA player data, inclusing a regression model to predict tournament performance by player.

#### Programming for Analytics (EMSE 6574; Fall, 2021; Grade: A)

This course was taught by Maksim Tsvetovat. Introduction to programming for data analytics using the Python programming language. Topics covered include introduction to the Python programming language, structured program design in Python, data structures for analytics in Python, visualization/plotting, file I/O, basic data analytics methods, data acquisition from real-world sources, database storage and retrieval, working with Python libraries including NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas. The more advanced topics covered include regression, support vector machines, and NLP. My final project for this course was a time series analysis of cryptocurrencies, their market coorelation, and their relationship with the S&P 500.

#### Data Analysis for Engineers and Scientists (EMSE 6765; Fall, 2021; Grade: A)

This course was taught by Dr. Johan Ren√© van Dorp. The topic in this course included estimation, hypothesis testing, and goodness-of-fit testing for univariate data. Multivariate topics include Hotelling T-squared hypothesis testing, regression analysis, principal component analysis, and analysis of variance. Assignments for this class must be kept private, but the final papers included an in-depth regrssion analysis and principal component analysis.
