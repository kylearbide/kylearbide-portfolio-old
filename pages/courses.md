#### Intro to Big Data and Analytics (CSCI 6444; Spring, 2022)

This course is taught by Professor Stephen Kaisler. The objectives of this course include introducing Big Data concepts, issues, and challenges, working with Big Data tools, and understanding advanced analytics including complex problems facing business, society, and engineering. The assignments in this course consist of Graph Analytics, Clustering & Predictive Analysis, and Text Analytics. For my term paper, I will be conducting a literature review on how Big Data is used in crime analysis and prediction.

#### Database Management Systems for Data Analytics (CSCI 6907; Spring, 2022)

This course is taught by Dr. Joel Klein. The learning outcomes for this couse include learning the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, understanding what database best suit a problem, manipulating data in each type of database, integration of databases into data pipelines, and exploring the benefits of cloud services. The assignments for this course include one project for each MondoDB, MySQL, and Graph databases section. The final project has yet to be announced.

#### Applied Machine Learning Analysis (EMSE 6575; Spring, 2022)

This course is taught by Dr. Benjamin Harvey. The learning outcomes for this couse include selecting and applying the most appropriate algorithms to real world data, evaluating the quality of algorithms, and understanding the principals of each algorithm, to better understand where they to and dont apply. The assignment topics consist of data gathering and processing, regression, classification, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. The final project will be a in depth analysis and model fitting to any dataset of our choice.

#### Data Analytics Introduction and Practicum (SEAS 6401; Fall, 2021; Grade: A)

This course was taught by Dr. Benjamin Harvey. The goals for this course included explaning data science, exploratory data analysis, satistical modeling, and their applications. This included working with Python and R, as well as with Apache Spark APIs including PySpark and Spark SQL. The assignments included working with Delta Lake and TensorFlow through Databricks to build and train deep learning models. The course included a varierty of guest lecturers who provided their own experiences with machine learning application and integration. My final project for this course was an exploratory analysis of PGA player data, inclusing a regression model to predict tournament performance by player.

#### Data Analysis for Engineers and Scientists (EMSE 6765; Fall, 2021; Grade: A)

This course was taught by Dr. Johan Ren√© van Dorp. The topic in this course included estimation, hypothesis testing, and goodness-of-fit testing for univariate data. Multivariate topics include Hotelling T-squared hypothesis testing, regression analysis, principal component analysis, and analysis of variance. Assignments for this class must be kept private, but the final papers included an in-depth regrssion analysis and principal component analysis.
